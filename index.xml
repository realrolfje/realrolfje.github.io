&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After wearing a simple Pulsar analog watch for years, and then not wearing a watch at all, I convinced myself a month ago that an Apple Watch 8 would be an improvement. Part of that decision was based on my hipster IT colleagues being surprised I was not wearing a smartwatch. I also noticed my girlfriend practically can't live without hers, and then I saw this endless stream of youtube videos with raving reviews of (lets be honest) pretty biased people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first week was okay and I had fun with my new toy. It is fast, reacts well to touch input, measures sleep, charges in 30 minutes or so, shows the time and my calendar when I raise my wrist, wakes me up by tapping on my wrist without waking the whole house. But then there were some little annoyances.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="all-push-messages-are-equal">All push messages are equal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When a message arrives and you have set your Apple Watch to &amp;quot;match the iPhone notification settings&amp;quot;, you will notice that the Apple watch actually does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> match those settings. On my iPhone I have carefully set all notifications sounds so that I can tell the difference between a group message in an unimportant group, or an important message from family or friends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Apple Watch does not care. All push messages sound like &amp;quot;Ding&amp;quot; and have the same vibration pattern. This means that you &lt;em>always&lt;/em> have to raise your wrist and look at your watch to be able to tell if it was an important message or not. This means that I went from not having to look at my phone, I now needed to look at my wrist on every &amp;quot;Ding&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is amazing that a computer on your wrist which can play music from internal storage, stream it over bluetooth to your earbuds, listens to &amp;quot;Hey Siri&amp;quot; and can even be your speakerphone cannot even mimic the short simple notification sounds from your phone. There is simply no way, the Aple Watch only has 8 built in sounds for notifications, and that's it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="quick-replies-are-funky">Quick replies are funky&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Apple Watch supports an on-screen keyboard (which is pretty tiny and almost impossible to type on) and some pretty good speech recognition to be able to reply to messages. The best idea however is the &amp;quot;Quick Reply&amp;quot;. Being able to have pre-defined responses like &amp;quot;Yes thanks&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;No thank you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Call you back later&amp;quot; is a pretty good feature for a smart watch. However, on the Apple Watch it does not always work. I'm not sure if it is supposed to guess the language or not, but it often shows you predefined responses in the wrong language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even worse, the predefined responses &lt;em>only work in iMessage&lt;/em>. When you receive a Telegram or Whatsapp message you are in the hands of the developer of that app. This makes the experience very inconsistent, and most of those apps don't even let you create or change predefined responses.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="standup-but-sitdown">Standup! But sitdown!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Apple Watch is really good in reminding you to stand up, do exercize, reward you with fake medals. It almost reminds you too poop regularly. If you like that stuff the Apple Watch is for you. But you have to deal with one really annoying detail: These reminders &lt;strong>are only triggered exactly 10 minutes before the whole hour.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my iPhone I have set the calendar so that new events automatically get a reminder 10 minutes before start. Really handy for meetings in the office. But when those meetings start at the top of the hour, the 10 minute reminder coincides with the reminder to stand up. At 50 minutes past the hour, my wrist was notification chaos.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-watch-face-you-cant-get">The watch face you can't get&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure class="float_right">&lt;a href="nightstand.png">&lt;img src="nightstand.png" width="150"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If you have configured focus modes like I have, the iPhone and the Apple Watch go into &amp;quot;Nightstand&amp;quot; mode between 22:00 and 08:00. Only contacts in my favourites list can call or ping me at those times. The Apple Watch shows a really nice watch face that looks like a classic alarm clock. A nice green color, nice font, no frills. It is surprising that this watch face is not selectable as a default watch face on the Apple Watch. Some watch faces are &amp;quot;more special than others&amp;quot; I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-dissapearing-workouts">The dissapearing workouts&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Apple watch knows when you are working out. It can detect and start recording a workout for different sports. You can switch off the autodetect and manually start a workout recording, which I preferred. A little downside is that I wasn't able to create a &amp;quot;Padel&amp;quot; workout type so I used &amp;quot;Tennis&amp;quot; for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the workout, when you open the Health app on your iPhone, you'll notice that... the workout is not there. You need to open a special separate app to view the heartrate data during your workout, for some strange reason. The workout app on the iPhone is very limited, there is no pinch and zoom to see your data in the detail you'd like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nice for casual hipster sporting, but not for serious athletes or data nerds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="no-time-for-you">No time for you&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you want the battery of the Apple Watch to last for more than 24 hours, you need to play with the settings and disable some services. Disabeling the &amp;quot;Hey Siri&amp;quot; is one of the better ways to save battery life, The other thing I disabled was the &amp;quot;always on&amp;quot; display, also because I think that the watch faces are funny and functional, but not really beautiful. They don't give that luxurious watch feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you configue the watch that way, you have to raise your wrist to have the watch display the time. When your wrist is already almost in that posution (like when typing on a keyboard), the twist of the wrist is often not enough to actually turn on the display. If you are easily annoyed by little things like this you'll understand that this started to be an annoyance.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hip-to-be-square">Hip to be square&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One of the things that always held me back from buying an Apple Watch is that it is a square watch. I think it is not a very flattering or elegant design. I bought the small version (41mm) because the bigger version looks like you strapped an iPhone 1 to your wrist, and that just looks silly. I am a fan of round watches, and the Apple Watch simply isn't.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="walkie-talkie-lock-in">Walkie Talkie lock-in&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5_2zOXo7Ks">Walkie Talkie app&lt;/a> on the Apple Watch is fun. Being able to talk to someone all the time gives a funny connected feeling. It is also a bit dangerous in meetings, so luckily you can also switch it off temporarily. The technology used for the Walkie Talkie audio stream is likely a FaceTime Audio stream. Too bad that the Walkie Talkie app is not also on your iPhone, I think I would have like that, just for fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then again, after a few times having fun with it, the Walkie Talkie app is not a deal breaker. It is a funny gimmick that might come in handy in the supermarket or when playing in the garden, but for serious applications it is a bit finnicky. It looses connection easily, reconnecting takes some time, and sending a Whatsapp Audio message is not very different.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-is-it-any-good">So is it any good?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you are in the market for a smartwatch and you like Apple products like I do, the Apple Watch is probably fine for you. It does the job, it has an Apple Logo and is of good build quality. No worries there. If you're really picky like I am, you'll run into the limitations I listed above pretty fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tip: If you do buy one, I recommend buying the elastic braded solo strap for it, it's really comfortable and thin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ECG app is very impressive and could be really helpful for people who want or need to check how their hart is beating. It can give a good indication of atrial fibrillation and might help you to contact a doctor in time.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure class="float_right">&lt;a href="seiko_5_snk803.jpg">&lt;img src="seiko_5_snk803.jpg" width="200"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I tried the Apple Watch for a good month, wearing it day and night. I had good fun with it, but when the novelty wears off I think it underperforms as a regular watch, and feels like an old &lt;a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi">tamagotchi&lt;/a>. It constantly requires your attention, breaks your concentration, distracts you during conversations, and gives up on you when you don't charge it daily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So in the end, I gave it to my girlfriend and replaced it with a &lt;a href="https://fifthwrist.com/seiko-snk803-review/">Seiko 5 Automatic field watch, model SNK803&lt;/a>. I went from simple quartz to full smartwatch to a full mechanical watch without any electronics at all. It is a much nicer watch to look at and does not feel like a screaming kid on my arm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose whatever works for you,
have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cardo Freecom 4+ Duo: The best?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2022/06/16/cardo-freecom-4-duo-the-best/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2022/06/16/cardo-freecom-4-duo-the-best/</guid><description>
&lt;figure class="float_right">&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09-NitLakfM">&lt;img src="cardo-freecom-4-plus-duo.png" width="150"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In this modern world motorcycle riders (Bikers) have many great options for communicating wirelessly with their riding buddies. Or so you should think. In reality, there are two major players in the motorcycle communication industry, namely &lt;a href="https://www.sena.com/eu-en">Sena&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.cardosystems.com/">Cardo&lt;/a>. Of course there are other brands and options, but Sena and Cardo are considered the &amp;quot;top of the line&amp;quot; in bluetooth helmet-to-helmet audio communication, supporting music, talk, navigation instructions, Siri and Google Asistant support, and even group chats between multiple riders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used to have a really cheap brandless bluetooth headset in my helmet to hear navigation instructions, but in the end all it did was just produce some distant unintelligable voice in my helmet which triggered me to have a look at the screen on my handlebars to see what the next instruction was. That was sort of okay, until I found myself in need of helmet-to-helmet communication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to spend some money on a good product, expecting to have a hassle-free, seemless and good sounding solution which would not distract from the riding. After reading online reviews and seeing a bunch of youtube videos, the &lt;a href="https://www.cardosystems.com/fr/shop/freecom-4-duo/">Cardo Freecom 4+ JBL Duo&lt;/a> set seemed like the best fit. With a list price of â¬449,95, I fully expected smooth sailing. It turns out that the waters in the motorcycle bluetooth world are a bit rough.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="receiving-and-installing-the-goods">Receiving and installing the goods&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No unboxing video here, but I can tell you that the packaging makes a good impression. Installation of the JBL speakers inside the helmets was very easy for the &lt;a href="https://www.shoei.com/worldwide/en/helmet/system/neotec_ii/">Shoei Neotec helmet&lt;/a>, where they precisely fit in the cutouts, but the Nolan helmet was prepared for a Nolan communications set, so I had to cut up some plastics in the helmet to make it work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Neotec is a flip-up helmet. Cardo provides a boom mike for that but I wanted to have the mic in the chin bar. Sadly, the wire for the provided chin-bar mic was too short to run towards the hinge and back so I had to lengthen that myself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For two helmets, this took me roughly an hour or so. Take your time to install everything in the right place, this will save you some time and frustration later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-1-software-update">Step 1: Software update?&lt;/h2>
&lt;figure class="float_right">&lt;a href="cardo-connect-app.jpg">&lt;img src="cardo-connect-app.jpg" width="80"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After installing the &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cardo-connect/id1333553210">Cardo Connect&lt;/a> app on my iPhone and pairing the Freecom 4+ with my phone, the app shows a warning that the firmware of the Freecom is version 3.3, and the newest version is 3.6. Although the Cardo website and the manual state that software update can be done &amp;quot;over the air&amp;quot;, this turns out to not be the case. The Cardo Connect app on the phone tells you to connect the Cardo to your laptop with a USB cable, and install the &lt;a href="https://www.cardosystems.com/update">Cardo Updater&lt;/a> app on your laptop. This process takes around 5 minutes (updating the Freecom takes a long time). In my case, I needed to update two Freecoms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-2-talk">Step 2: Talk&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Freecom 4+ Duo set comes paired out of the box. It is a selling point, until you learn that pairing the two Freecoms is as simple as pressing and holding the intercom button (top button) on both units at the same time. If you see two single units for less than the Duo option, buy the singles. This is the complete process to establish an audio connection between two (paired) units:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Turn on both units by pressing the play and phone buttons simultaniously.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait for the Freecom to say &amp;quot;Rider A connected&amp;quot; (note that this does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> start the audio channel yet)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shortly press the intercom button on one of the two Freecoms. You will hear 3 beeps going &amp;quot;up&amp;quot;. You can now talk to the other rider. You can keep this channel open for as long as you want. We generally keep the intercom open for the whole trip.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pressing the intercom button again will stop the intercom channel. You will hear 3 beeps going down. This feedback is good to have so you know when the other rider decided to stop listening to you ;-)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="step-3-navigation">Step 3: Navigation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you use the Freecom to just talk, it will do that beautifully out of the box. If you also want to pair it to your navigation, you might want to take your helmet off first, as it will damage your ears on the default setting. To pair your navigation, you need to pay close attention to what you are doing:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Press and hold the Phone button (rear button) of the Freecom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When you hear &amp;quot;Mobile one, pairing&amp;quot;, let go and press the rear button again. You will hear &amp;quot;Mobile two, pairing&amp;quot;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then, turn the volume control wheel forward (clockwise). You will hear &amp;quot;GPS, pairing&amp;quot;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Go to your navigation device (a Tomtom rider 550 in my case) and in the bluetooth menu select &amp;quot;Pair Audio device&amp;quot;. The Cardo Freecom should be visible in the list. Tap it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make sure the tomtom 550 does &lt;em>not&lt;/em> use the AD2P high quality audio setting. High quality audio will make the Cardo loose connection with your phone and possibly your riding buddies (a list of problems and fixes is at the end of this article). Use HSP (low) audio quality only.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;em>IMPORTANT&lt;/em>: The only audio channel of the Freecom that actually &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMSV4OteqBE&amp;amp;t=82s">goes to 11&lt;/a> is the navigation volume, and that is it's default setting. In the volume settings of the Cardo Connect app there is no way to correct this. Here's how to fix that:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Tomtom Rider, go to the settings screen where you can choose a voice. In this screen, when you tap on a voice, you will hear something like &amp;quot;Hi, I am Mike, I can read street names&amp;quot;. When the Tomtom plays this sound, you can roll the volume wheel of the Cardo Freecom to turn it down. The Freecom will remember this setting (yes there &lt;em>is&lt;/em> an internal setting, but the Cardo Connect app does not show it to you).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="step-4-listening-to-music">Step 4: Listening to Music&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You probably already paired your phone to the Cardo Freecom by now, it's the first thing I did, hoping to be able to set it up easily. If you did, you can probably already play some music on your cardo, although it will be a bit wierd to get it going.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Say &amp;quot;Hey Cardo, Music On&amp;quot; in your helmet, or press the &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; button on the front of your freecom. Cardo will respond with &amp;quot;Music On&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Depending on what your phone is doing, and wether you have an intercom channel open (more on that later), you can press &amp;quot;play&amp;quot; on your phone to listen to some music. If that does not work, switch off the Cardo Freecom and try again. I have the real fix for you &lt;a href="#trouble-shooting">further down in this article&lt;/a>, but for now lets go for the reliable route.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>If you have the JBL speakers with your Freecom 4+ like I have, the music will sound pretty good, when you have the helmet on your head in the living room. But for riding the bike, it might not nearly be loud enough. If you have an iPhone, this can be improved by going into the iPhone &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Audio&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Headphone safety&amp;quot;, and then switch off he headphone safety feature. This will make the volume of the music almost twice as loud, but be careful when connecting normal earbuds to your iPhone, as you can now ruin your ears. It's sad that this setting is not device specific.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The funny thing is, that even with this setting and all settings in the Cardo Connect app, I have never gotten my music volume to play at the rediculously loud volume of the navigation instructions. When riding at 100+ km/h, the volume of the music is just enough to hear it, but don't expect ear-shattering sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="optional-music-sharing">Optional: Music Sharing&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the cardo flyer, it says that you can share the music you are hearing with your riding buddy by holding the intercom button for 2 seconds. &lt;em>This does not work.&lt;/em> The way to get musing shared with your riding buddy is:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Stop the intercom mode if you had it open.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start playing music by using the &amp;quot;Cardo On&amp;quot; and maybe &amp;quot;Hey Siri&amp;quot; commands.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When musinc is playing, press the intercom button shortly (just click). The music will stop, and you will be able to talk to your buddy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>With the intercom channel open, press and hold the intercom button. The music will start playing and after a few seconds your buddy will hear the music.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The strange thing is that in this mode, you can not talk to eachother (although you are in intercom mode). To return to intercom mode, press and hold the intercom button for 2 seconds. Music will stop and intercom will be on again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pairing-order-and-other-myths">Pairing order and other myths&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You will find a lot of articles online about the order in which you pair devices, and also that you should pair your phone to your Tomtom to make things work. This is all nonsense. The order in which you pair devices has nothing to do with the audio settings or functionality. The tomtom does not need your iPhone to talk to your Cardo Freecom. Even worse: Pairing the iPhone to the Tomtom will lead you into a lot of connection trouble (this is a tomtom problem I won't go into right now), and it will only add to the confusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The correct pairings (in no particular order) are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tomtom to Freecom A (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Phone A to Freecom A (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Freecom B to Freecom A (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Phone B to Freecom B (optional)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="trouble-shooting">Trouble shooting&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Freecom 4+ (like other Cardo's I've seen) has some strange usability problems which can make life pretty difficult. Here are the problems I had and what I had to do to fix them. Note that the units were new, with default settings, and not all stuff &amp;quot;just works&amp;quot; out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I can't get any music to play, even though Cardo says &amp;quot;Music On&amp;quot;&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The Freecom replies &amp;quot;Music On&amp;quot; &lt;em>even when it is not able to play music&lt;/em>. Check that intercom mode is off, and that the tomtom is not in AD2P mode, and that your can hear the tomtom instructions at decent volume. Check the volume setting on your phone, it should be turned all the way up. Check that the hearing damage safety feature is off on your iPhone. Check that there is actually something playing on your phone, and slowly turn the volume wheel of your Cardo. It will beep when you reach the highest volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I can't share music with another rider&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Sharing music can only done by first stopping the intercom, then starting the music, then starting the intercom, and &lt;em>then&lt;/em> starting the sharing mode, see earlier in this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bluetooth connections drop&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Your tomtom is in AD2P mode. Do not connect your tomtom in AD2P mode, only use HSP mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Navigation audio is rediculously loud&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Make your tomtom talk by going into the settings meny where you can select a different voice. Tap any of the voices and while it is talking, turn the volume wheel of the Freecom. This will change the individual setting of the navigation volume (music volume will stay unchanged).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hey Siri does not work&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The Cardo Freecom listens to &amp;quot;Hey Siri&amp;quot;, but noth through your phone. You need to talk American English to make the Cardo detect that. Once Cardo responds with &amp;quot;Hey Siri&amp;quot;, you can then talk to your iPhone in your normal language or dialect. The easiest way to circumvent this reliability problem is to just press the phone button (rear button of the Freecom) to summon Siri. There is a delay before Siri starts listening. See what this delay is by trying a couple of times with your phone in your hand to see what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Siri says I need to unlock the phone&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Even if you configured Siri to also listen on the lock screen, you can still have problems when using Siri to try to call someone. In the privacy settings of your iPhone, find the &amp;quot;Allow Voice Dialing&amp;quot; setting and turn it on. Note that your iPhone does not need to listen to &amp;quot;Hey Siri&amp;quot; for this to work, as Cardo sends the Hey Siri command to your iPhone in a different way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If the Cardo Freecom is indeed the pinnacle of Motorcycle communication, then I am pretty dissapointed with the whole industry. Usability is awful, and features were added before getting even the basics working correctly. Things that surprised me are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When navigation starts talking, your intercom stops working, regardless if you were mid-sentence. Your riding buddy could be talking and you would not even know. Your buddy does not hear the audio instructions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Although Tomtom has a &amp;quot;high quality AD2P mode&amp;quot;, this will confuse your Freecom to the point where it randomly drops connections. With your tomtom in AD2P mode, you will not be able to play music (reliably) from your phone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>When giving voice commands to the Cardo, it will not inform you that it can't do what you asked. &amp;quot;Hey Cardo, Music On&amp;quot; will not always start playing music. It would have been more useful if Cardo would reply with &amp;quot;Sorry, can't play music in intercom mode&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even though the Cardo Connect app has this fancy volume levels mix panel, none of the audio channels can actually play simultaniously. You can not intercom while listening to music, and you can also not intercom when tomtom starts shouting at you.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The audio level for navigation &lt;em>is&lt;/em> an internal setting in the Freecom, but this setting is not available in the Carco Connect app. There is no explanation or obvious way to change this other than what I described in this article.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Navigation audio can not play in AD2P mode, and the Freecom can not reliably simultaniously handle (and mix) two AD2P audio streams from your navigation and phone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reconnecting devices after power off and on is noticebly slow. Any bluetooth speaker pairs to my iPhone in under 2 seconds. The Freecom however sometimes needs close to 20 seconds to say &amp;quot;Phone paired&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;GPS paired&amp;quot;.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even if you give your intercom the highest priority in your Card Connect app, the tomtom can still override your intercom discussion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The recently added &amp;quot;audio mixing&amp;quot; feature in the Cardo Connect app renders the Freecom useless. As soon as I switched this on, everything stopped working. No music, no intercom, no tomtom. How did this pass &lt;em>any&lt;/em> testing or QA process?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The standard speaker sets that come with Cardo products are inferior, low volume and useless. The only way to fix this is to buy the expensive JBL option. The default speakersets of Cardo are not very usable on the road.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Even with JBL speakers, there is only so much Cardo can do (apart from the rediculous default navigation volume). Simply repositioning the speakers is not always possible in modern helmets with predefined cutouts for the speakers. Sounds nice when you are in a living room, or reviewing it on youtube, but too low when you ride with ear protection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Response from Siri are way too low volume to be intelligable on a motorcycle.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I am surprised to learn that motorcycle riders need to pay so much money for such a buggy, finnicky and frustrating product which has too many features without focussing on what it should do. Is it really that hard to create a hassle free audio connection which can handle navigation and intercom simultaniously in high quality? It is also saddening that there are so many youtube videos praising this product without mentioning these flaws. I can only guess that most videos are sponsored, and not actual rider reviews.

&lt;p>Ben je leraar in het basisonderwijs en wil je weten wat je nieuwe salaris wordt nu er een akkoord is over
het dichten van de salariskloof tussen het PO (Primair Onderwijs / basisonderwijs) en het VO
(Voortgezet Onderwijs)? Aan de hand van de huidige &lt;a href="CAO_PO_salaristabellen_per_1-1-2022.pdf">salarisschalen voor PO&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="CAO_VO_salaristabellen_per_1-10-2021.pdf">salarisschalen voor VO&lt;/a>, en de &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ejAEcVt-drE">uitleg van de Algemene Onderwijsbond&lt;/a>
kom ik op onderstaande nieuwe schalen, treden en salarissen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Onderstaande maandbedragen gaan per 1 januari 2022, dus met terugwerkende kracht, in. Daarnaast:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ga je in augustus ga je 1 trede omhoog in je (VO) salarisschaal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ga je twee jaar later nog een trede omhoog in je salarisschaal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ontvang je aan het einde van het kalenderjaar een volle 13e maand op basis van het dan geldende salaris&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ontvang je aan het einde van het jaar ook een bindingstoelage als je in de hoogste trede van je loonschaal zit&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Doordat de twee systemen gelijk getrokken worden en de cao's uitelkaar zijn gelopen pakt de verhoging niet voor iedereen even gunstig uit. Zit je bijvoorbeeld nu in schaal L11 trede 8, dan ga je 2,9% omhoog. Zit je daarentegen in L13 trede 1, dan ga je 29,2% omhoog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let op! Aan deze indicatie kun je geen rechten ontlenen, doe altijd voor de zekerheid altijd zelf een
controleberekening.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;figure class="float_left">&lt;a href="https://methodshop.com/disable-new-wordpress-editor-gutenberg/">&lt;img src="wordpress-trashcan.png" width="80"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
For years I have happily used WordPress.org to host my blog. I enjoyed writing articles, helping and interacting with people who take the time to read the longform articles. For a whole slew of reasons my attention to my blog decreased to almost zero. One of the big parts in that is the &amp;quot;Gutenberg Editor&amp;quot; or the &amp;quot;Block Editor&amp;quot; which suddenly appeared in WordPress. It made writing blogposts a horrible, cumbersome experience. Another frustration was the breaking of layouts of old posts because of &amp;quot;upgrades&amp;quot; to the theme I am using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to make editting text easier more enjoyable, I started looking for an alternative. I found &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> to be a good candidate. It has a few pros and cons compared to WordPress:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Pro&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Con&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>Write posts in markdown.&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Harder to host&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>100% control of updates and layout&lt;/td>
&lt;td>Migration broke a lot, repairs will take a while&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>No ads&lt;/td>
&lt;td>No comments or user interaction (yet)&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>As you might have noticed, I am hosting the blog on github pages now. It seems to work okay, and if needed I can should be able to more easily move to a new hosting location if needed, since all files are now pre-rendered static HTML. No PHP to hack, no servers to compromise, just plain HTML.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are a regular visitor of &lt;code>rolfje.com&lt;/code> you already noticed quite a difference in layout. Older articles are mostly broken now, sorry about that, it will take a while to fix. I hope that this fix is a one time thing, making it truly future proof. There's also new cool stuff: Go ahead and switch to dark mode by clicking on the sun in the header, or search for articles, or check out the rss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another big thing is the comments. I need to find a way to migrate the old comments into this site (if possible), and I also need a new mechanism for people to comment on my posts. The Hugo website &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/comments/#readout">mentions a few&lt;/a>, I'll try to see what works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, please sit tight, or if you really need an old post go to &lt;a href="https://rolfje.wordpress.com/">https://rolfje.wordpress.com/&lt;/a>, I'll probably keep that around, at least until I migrated everything and have a way to forward visitors of that blog to this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cheers,&lt;br>

I am a great fan of using munin for monitoring my servers and I have quite an extensive setup that even sends me Telegram messages when something is wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This weekend I ran into an interesting problem with a backupserver where the âdfâ plugin on the node did not want to list the backup disk, and Iâve spent quite some time trying to figure out what the problem was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hereâs the fstab setup for my machine:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>proc /proc proc defaults 0 0
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>PARTUUID=698b7a16-01 /boot vfat defaults 0 2
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>PARTUUID=698b7a16-02 / ext4 defaults,noatime 0 1
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>UUID=6ef2cb75 /home/pi/usbdisk ext4 defaults 0 2
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When I run âdfâ on my machine it returns the expected results:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln"> 1&lt;/span># df
&lt;span class="ln"> 2&lt;/span>Filesystem 1K-blocks Used Available Use% Mounted on

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>After hours of debugging the perl script (I can not recommend that to anyone) and trying restarting, rebooting and other voodoo, I found a non-related redit post about systemd and protecting home directories. The keen-eyed reader has spotted that my disk is mounted on &lt;code>/home/pi/usbdisk&lt;/code> (letâs say thatâs for artistic reasons).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A quick peek in &lt;code>/lib/systemd/system/munin-node.service&lt;/code> shows that this is property indeed set to &lt;code>ProtectHome=true&lt;/code> (which makes sense). Of course I have the option to mount the disk somewhere else, but since my raspberry is behind 2 (!) firewalls and only operated by myself I solved the problem as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Edit &lt;code>/lib/systemd/system/munin-node.service&lt;/code> and set &lt;code>ProtectHome=false&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span># systemctl daemon-reload
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span># systemctl restart munin-node
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>A quick check shows that the disk is now indeed listed:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="ln"> 1&lt;/span># nc localhost 4949

Iedereen is het zat. Dat hele gedoe met al die regels. Zo zat, dat we elkaar nu aan het uitleggen zijn dat het allemaal best meevalt en dat we het eigenlijk wel prima doen. Dat de scholen en de winkels en de horeca eigenlijk wel prima open kunnen. Het OMT wordt gedwongen &lt;a href="98e-omt-advies-deel-1-highlight.jpg">onwetenschappelijke beleidsuitspraken&lt;/a> te doen die niet in hun expertisegebied liggen, en vervolgens worden die uitspraken als voorwendsel gebruikt om versoepelingen door te voeren. Als je goed leest in de OMT verslagen, en als je luistert naar de experts die de ministers iedere week geduldig te woord staan in informatiesessies, zijn de experts allemaal van mening dat de cijfers geen aanleiding geven tot versoepeling. Iedere expert vertelt in verhulde termen dat ze volledig verwachten dat het aantal besmettingen en ziekenhuisopnames zal stijgen. En stiekem weten we dat allemaal zelf ook wel, toch?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Een deel van die sociale druk lijkt te komen doordat de regering de bevolking iets oplegt waarvan ze de effecten en timing niet begrijpen. Ik moet eerlijk zeggen dat ik de timing en de gekozen maatregelen ook niet altijd even goed begrijp. De koehandel in de debatten in de tweedekamer resulteren in naijlende maatregelen die niet lijken aan te sluiten bij de corona cijfers, en misschien nog wel minder bij de situatie waarin veel mensen in het land zich in bevinden. Gefrustreerde ouders en kinderen wapperen met een &lt;a href="https://nieuwscheckers.nl/nieuwscheckers/nieuws-over-dreigende-corona-burnout-bij-80-procent-van-jongeren-is-totale-quatsch/">gefingeerd onderzoek&lt;/a>, beweren onterecht dat &lt;a href="https://suicidepreventiecongres.nl/nieuws/cans-duiding-februari-geen-toename-in-suicides/">zelfmoordcijfers zijn gestegen&lt;/a> en krijgen zo de scholen weer geopend, terwijl kleine ondernemers (met kinderen) failliet gaan, ouderen wegkwijnen in afgesloten verpleeghuizen en zorgpersoneel (ook met kinderen) hun ziekenhuis weer zien volstromen met COVID-19 patienten.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="hoe-dan-wel">Hoe dan wel?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Nederlanders zijn goed in klagen en vertellen dat iemand het niet goed doet. Vooral onze regering heeft het flink te verduren. Er is geen maatregel of uitspraak die niet bekritiseerd wordt, hoe goed de wetenschappelijke onderbouwing ook is. Ook in mijn omgeving merk ik dat mensen gefrustreerd zijn en mopperen, maar een andere aanpak, nieuwe inzichten of oplossingen zitten daar nooit tussen. Laat ik eens een poging wagen:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over het algemeen vind ik dat onze regering het best goed deed, tot het einde van 2020. Natuurlijk is het nooit perfect, en zijn er keuzes gemaakt &lt;a href="https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/03/27/voor-uw-eigen-veligheid/">die ik niet zou maken&lt;/a>, maar over het algemeen is er goed gemeten en nagedacht, alles open en transparant. De communicatie liet wat te wensen over, maar dat kwam vooral in de ingewikkelde uitzonderingen waardoor maatregelen voor veel mensen onduidelijk waren. âWaarom zij wel en ik nietâ ligt dan heel erg dichtbij, en dat is iets dat ik zelf anders had gedaan. Geen sport betekent Ã³Ã³k geen voetbal. Niet samenkomen in een clubhuis betekent Ã³Ã³k geen kerkdiensten. Gelijke monikken, gelijke kappen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Er is nog iets anders belangrijks waar onze regering wel mee was gestart, maar daarna op pijnlijke wijze heeft laten liggen: Signaalwaarden. Er werd een &lt;a href="https://coronadashboard.rijksoverheid.nl/">prachtig dashboard&lt;/a> gebouwd, waarin het aantal positieve tests, ziekenhuisopnames en allerlei andere meetgegevens op te zien waren. Aan een aantal van die getallen werden âsignaalwaardenâ gekoppeld. Voor mij persoonlijk heeft de geloofwaardigheid van onze regering een flinke deuk opgelopen door vervolgens niets met die signaalwaarden te doen. Een voorbeeld van de cijfers en de gruwelijke overschreiding van hun signaalwaarden zie je hieronder:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="signaalwaarde-positieve-tests.png">&lt;img src="signaalwaarde-positieve-tests.png" width="210"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="signaalwaarde-ziekenhuisopnames.png">&lt;img src="signaalwaarde-ziekenhuisopnames.png" width=210/>&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="signaalwaarde-ic-opnames.png">&lt;img src="signaalwaarde-ic-opnames.png" width=210/>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wat mij betreft lag hier een cruciale kans om meer draagvlak te creeren en mensen zelf controle te geven over het verloop van de pandemie. Laten we even het aantal opnames op de Intensive Care nemen als voorbeeld:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="grafiek-ic-opnames.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In bovenstaande grafiek zien we dat op 22 september vorig jaar de signaalwaarde van 10 IC opnames per dag overschreden werd. En in de weken daarvoor zagen we dat al oplopen. Wat mij betreft had het beleid en persconferenties voorafgaand aan 22 september simpeler gekund:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We hebben met zijn allen besloten dat we de ICâs niet willen overbelasten. Daarvoor moeten we onder de 10 IC opnames per dag blijven.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Als we zien dat we die 10 naderen, wijzen we op het dashboard, en leggen uit met welke simpele maatregelen iedereen zelf kan zorgen dat dat naar beneden gaat (1,5 meter, handen wassen, thuisblijven).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Voordat de grenswaarde wordt overschreden wordt maken we duidelijk welke regeringsmaatregelen dan in werking treden (gestaffeld). Bijvoorbeeld:&lt;br/>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bij meer dan 10 IC opnames per dag gaan de winkels dicht.&lt;br/>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bij meer dan 12 IC opnames per dag gaan de sportscholen dicht.&lt;br/>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bij meer dan 14 IC opnames per dag gaan de scholen dicht.&lt;br/>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bij meer dan 16 opnames volgt er een avondklok.&lt;br/>
En andersom: Bij minder dan 16 opnames vervalt de avondklok, en zo verder.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Door mensen van te voren uit te leggen waneer maatregelen ingaan, en hoe ze daar zelf invloed op hebben maak je ze eigenaar van het probleem. Hierdoor wordt heel duidelijk dat je eigen acties resulteren in het openhouden of sluiten van horeca of scholen. Mijn stelling is dat als we deze tactiek vanaf vorig jaar zomer hadden gevolgd de uitbraak met de kerst veel kleiner was geweest. Misschien hadden dan nu alweer horeca en winkels open gekund in dezelfde vorm als vorig jaar zomer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overigens zou ik zelf niet de IC opnames als signaalwaarde nemen, omdat die te lang naijlt. De acties van vandaag zie je pas over 2 a 3 weken terug in de IC opnames. Omdat we tegenwoordig veel meer en veel beter testen lijkt het het percentage positieve tests een veel werkbaarder getal omdat gedrag van deze week ook deze week terug te zien is in de testresultaten (u weet wel, dat wat onze journalisten constant incorrect âbesmettingenâ blijven noemen).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hoeven niet terug in de tijd om dit nu in te voeren, en het geeft gelijk het âperspectiefâ waar we allemaal zo naar hunkeren:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>De avondklok vervalt zodra het percentage positief geteste personen onder de 5% valt (eenvoudig doel)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Om dit te bereiken moeten we de maatregelen (1,5 meter, thuiswerken, handen wassen, mondkapjes) volgen (eenvoudig middel)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Het percentage is voor iedereen te zien op het coronadashboard (eenvoudig inzicht)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Alle middelen zijn al voorhanden. Een kleine aanpassing in communicatie, houding en beleid is voldoende. Het is misschien zelfs een goed idee om dit per regio inzichtelijk te maken, als een soort âgamificationâ, waarbij regios onderling de âcompetitieâ aan kunnen. Naar een hoofdprijs hoef je niet te zoeken, iedereen weet heel goed wat dat is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overigens is deze hele discussie natuurlijk over als we eindenlijk allemaal zijn ingeent, dat is iets waar de Europeesche Unie en onze regering wel iets steviger in de wedstrijd had mogen gaan zitten. Want van de âeerlijke verdeling van vaccinsâ waar iedereen het vorig jaar zo roerend over eens was is echt nog geen sprake. The proof of the pudding is in the eating.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;figure class="float_left">&lt;a href="https://www.echtscheiding-wijzer.nl/kosten-van-een-scheiding.html">&lt;img src="euro_symbol_gold-svg.png" width="50"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
Als u gaat scheiden, dan wordt bij het vaststellen van de hoogte van alimentatie bepaald wat uw financiele &amp;quot;draagkracht&amp;quot; is. Deze draagkracht is vaak netto, en wordt vervolgens teruggerekend naar een bruto draagkracht volgens de &amp;quot;methode Buijs&amp;quot;. De achterliggende berekening is echter vaak ook voor uw adviseur niet goed te volgen en het resulterende bedrag lijkt &amp;quot;magisch&amp;quot;. Dit kan om veel geld gaan, daarom hieronder een rekenvoorbeeld en uitleg zodat u het ook snapt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In onderstaand rekenvoorbeeld gaan we uit van een inkomen van â¬50.000, zonder bijzonderheden. We berekenen het netto besteedbaar inkomen dat overblijft na belastingen, berekenen op basis daarvan netto alimentatie, en rekenen die terug naar bruto alimentatie:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="methode-buijs-2018.png" alt="Methode Buijs voorbeeld berekening">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bij een belastbaar inkomen van â¬50.000 (ingevuld in cel F1) vallen delen van dat inkomen binnen de verschillende schijven (D3 t/m D6). Over die delen wordt belasting geheven volgens het bijbehorende tarief (E3 t/m/ E6). De totale heffing is de som van alle heffingen, in E7.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Om het netto besteedbaar inkomen te bepalen trekken we de geheven belasting van het bruto inkomen af, en tellen de &lt;a href="https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/prive/inkomstenbelasting/heffingskortingen_boxen_tarieven/heffingskortingen/algemene_heffingskorting/algemene_heffingskorting">heffingskorting&lt;/a> er bij op. We houden dan het netto besteedbaar inkomen over in F10.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voor de bepaling van de maximaal te eisen alimentatie word er uitgegaan van een &amp;quot;draagkrachtruimte&amp;quot;. Dit is het gedeelte van het netto salaris dat beschikbaar is na betaling van bijvoorbeeld vaste lasten. Omdat de vaste lasten soms lastig te bepalen zijn en kunnen veranderen wordt er vaak een percentage gebruikt. In dit geval gebruiken we 60% (E13), wat resulteert in een netto draagkrachtruimte (F13).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>De Methode Buijs&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Alimentatie is aftrekbaar van de belasting. In dit voorbeeld zouden we bijvoorbeeld een alimentatie uit een eerder huwelijk optellen bij de heffingskortingen (F9). De methode Buijs gebruikt de heffingsvrije delen uit de schijven (G3 t/m G6) om te berekenen uit welk gedeelte van het inkomen belasting is betaald om te komen tot de netto draagkrachtruimte.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In ons voorbeeld hebben we niets betaald in schijf IV (E6), dus daar hoeven we geen rekening mee te houden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Schijf III is er belasting geheven, zie E5. Het bedrag dat na heffing nog &amp;quot;beschikbaar&amp;quot; was voor heffing in die schijf is G5. Omdat de netto draagkrachtruimte groter is, nemen we het hele heffingsvrije bedrag en doen alsof daar belasting over is betaald om het gebruteerde bedrag te vinden in E17. Het bedrag in E17 is G5/(1-C5).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We trekken het bedrag waarover nu belasting is betaald af van de draagkrachtruimte en doen dezelfde berekening voor de resterende schijven, E18 t/m E19.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Als het ware &amp;quot;eten we het bedrag in F13 op&amp;quot; met brokjes zo groot als in G6 t/m G3, dus in omgekeerde volgorde van de schijven.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vervolgens tellen we alle gebruteerde bedragen op en komen tot het bruto in F20. Dit is het gedeelte van het bruto inkomen in F1 waarover belasting is betaald voor het vinden van de netto draagkrachtruimte in F13.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Let op:&lt;/strong> Deze berekening gaat over het bedrag dat &lt;em>beschikbaar&lt;/em> is, en moet berekend worden voor beide partijen. De hoogte en de richting van de daadwerkelijke alimentatie hangt af van een groot aantal factoren en is vaak onderwerp van lange strijd. De hoogte van het percentage voor het bepalen van de netto draagkrachtruimte kan worden betwist, en er kunnen allerlei redenen zijn waarom alimentatie uiteindelijk anders uitvalt dan partijen hadden gehoopt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Daarnaast is het goed om te beseffen dat een goede advocaat overtuigend kan redeneren en mooie teksten kan schrijven, maar niet noodzakelijkerwijs goed in rekenen is. Vaak is een advocaat verbazingwekkend genoeg ook niet bekend met de gevolgen en neveneffecten van een scheiding. Zo wisten onze advocaten bijvoorbeeld niet dat zonder een convenant geen hypotheek aangegaan kan worden, en leek een verhoging van de alimentatie met 10 euro per maand niet groot, terwijl dat voor de bank wel het verschil kan zijn tussen wel of niet de hypotheek krijgen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scheiden is een nachtmerrie. Blijf rustig en beleefd, let goed op wat je doet, controleer alles, zorg liefst samen voor een mediator en een financieel adviseur, maar als dat niet lukt dan een hele goede advocaat voor jezelf.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Testing Kotlin extension functions</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/07/01/testing-kotlin-extension-functions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 21:37:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/07/01/testing-kotlin-extension-functions/</guid><description>

&lt;/figure>
This might seem obvious for many Kotlin programmers but I did not realize that extension functions are also applied to mocks. This means that if you have a class you can not instantiate for some reason, like the constructor is private and in another package, or the class is abstract, you can still test your extension functions by simply mocking it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>Let's say I have an extension function on the &lt;code>com.sun.java.swing.action.ActionManager&lt;/code> which returns &lt;code>true&lt;/code> when the action manager contains a &lt;code>save&lt;/code> action. (Yes it is a silly example I know).&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="cm">/** Returns true if the actionManager has a &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; action */&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">fun&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nf">ActionManager&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">canSave&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">():&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">Boolean&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">=&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">getAction&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;save&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="o">==&lt;/span> &lt;span class="k">null&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Of course we want to test our extension function, but writing a complete subclass of ActionManager just to test the extension function would be silly. Instead you can simply mock it with mockk:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-kotlin" data-lang="kotlin">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">import&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nn">io.mockk.coEvery&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">import&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nn">io.mockk.mockk&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">3&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">..&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">.&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">4&lt;/span>&lt;span class="nd">@Test&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">5&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">internal&lt;/span> &lt;span class="k">fun&lt;/span> &lt;span class="nf">testCanSaveExtensionFunction&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">6&lt;/span> &lt;span class="k">val&lt;/span> &lt;span class="py">mockActionManager&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">:&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">ActionManager&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">=&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">mockk&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">7&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">coEvery&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">mockActionManager&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">getAction&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s2">&amp;#34;save&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">)&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">answers&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">{&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">mockk&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">()&lt;/span> &lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">8&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">assertEquals&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="k">true&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">,&lt;/span> &lt;span class="n">mockActionManager&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">canSave&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">())&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">9&lt;/span>&lt;span class="p">}&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This test will not only run your extension function, but you can even verify that the extension function calls the correct functions on the extended class because mockk lets you check invocations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems like a silly little tip, but I liked it so much when I found this out I thought I'd share it with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope to be more active on the blog again, until then happy coding!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Voor uw eigen veligheid</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/03/27/voor-uw-eigen-veligheid/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Mar 2020 17:49:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/03/27/voor-uw-eigen-veligheid/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sinds 21 maart vraagt onze regering ons om binnen te blijven bij verkoudheidsklachten. Sinds 23 maart last onze regering alle bijeenkomsten en evenementen af. Dat de KNVB denkt dat die regel niet voor hen geldt is nog even tot daaraantoe. Toch wordt onze vrijheid niet zodanig beperkt dat we niet naar buiten kunnen, of zelfs tegen het advies in elkaar kunnen bezoeken. Wat ook niet is veranderd is dat we net als de KNVB vinden dat maatregelen vooral over anderen gaan, en niet over onszelf.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>Over anderen beslissen, met alle goede bedoelingen, heeft grote gevolgen. Op 15 maart, een paar dagen voordat de rest van het land wat dwingender werd geadviseerd, ging het verpleeghuis waar mijn moeder verblijft geheel op slot. Dwingend. Niemand erin, niemand eruit. Zo'n zware beslissing wordt natuurlijk met de allerbeste bedoelingen genomen. Maar het voelt toch raar: Oude hulpbehoevende mensen die niet buiten komen, bijna geen sociale contacten hebben, niet in een drukke supermarkt staan te hoesten, niet lekker met elkaar blijven bootcampen tegen alle advies in, juist die mensen sluit je op.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mijn moeder komt, net als veel andere oudere mensen, door allerlei lichamelijke en geestelijke beperkingen bijna niet meer buiten. Diezelfde beperkingen zorgen ervoor dat ze geen iPad, computer of zelfs een simpele telefoon kan bedienen. Tot nu toe was dat geen probleem, mijn vader was er bijna altijd, en haar kinderen bijna iedere dag. We maakten er een gezellige boel van, en zorgden ook voor een beetje leven in de brouwerij bij andere bewoners en de verpleging. De verpleging doet heel erg haar best om iedereen te vermaken, maar de plotselinge isolatie zorgt nu voor een groot contrast.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Als je van de ene op de andere dag op je kleine kamertje moet blijven en geen bezoek meer krijgt, en de hele week erna ook niet, en je begrijpt niet goed waarom, en je hebt zelf geen middelen om contact te maken met de buitenwereld, dan wordt je leven heel erg naar. Het is niet voor niets dat eenzame opsluiting als ergste vorm van gevangenisstraf wordt gezien. En dat is wel precies wat we veel mensen aandoen met deze draconische maatregel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bij het nemen van de maatregel is er vanuit gegaan dat levens moeten worden gespaard. En omdat de rest van het volk niet in de hand te houden is, en de zwakkere mensen al wel in dergelijke huizen zitten, lijkt het logisch om die dan maar te isoleren. Voor hun eigen veiligheid. Maar daardoor krijgen de zwakkeren in de samenleving dan misschien geen COVID-19, maar mentaal wel de grootste klap. En die klappen hadden ze daarvoor ook al gehad, ze zitten immers in een situatie waarvan veel gezonde mensen niet in terecht zouden willen komen. Het enige wat ze nog hadden word ze ontnomen, ze kunnen alleen maar hopen dat ze hun kinderen nog eens zien voordat ze overlijden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Niemand heeft mijn moeder gevraagd of ze opgesloten wil worden. Niemand heeft haar gevraagd of ze misschien liever gewoon haar man en kinderen wil zien met het risico eerder te overlijden. Als ze die keuze voorgelegd zou krijgen, weet ik precies waarvoor ze zou kiezen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Het gaat niet om het aantal dagen in je leven.
Het gaat om het leven in je dagen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Ondanks &amp;quot;veilige opsluiting&amp;quot; werd ze toch ziek. Ze overleed 5 april. Alleen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2:&lt;/strong> We kwamen erachter dat de kaarten die we stuurden ongeopend bij haar spullen zaten. Ze heeft ze nooit gekregen, nooit gelezen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 3:&lt;/strong> Iedereen is enthausiast over het &amp;quot;spoorboekje&amp;quot; waarin de regering aangeeft hoe we weer op gaan starten. Iedereen is vol van de kapper en de IKEA want oh oh wat hebben we het toch zwaar, maar we lijken vergeten dat we onze ouders eenzaam hebben opgesloten. Op de website van de rijksoverheid &lt;a href="https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/coronavirus-covid-19/nieuws/2020/05/06/eerste-stap-nieuwe-bezoekregeling-verpleeghuizen">vind ik een artikel&lt;/a> waarin deze vergeten groep genoemd wordt. Zij mogen deze hele maand nog geen bezoek. Ik vind het walgelijk. Dit is hoe we met onze ouders omgaan. Respectloos.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reading an ISKRA AM550 P1 Port with a Pi</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/01/18/reading-an-iskra-am550-p1-port-with-a-pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jan 2020 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2020/01/18/reading-an-iskra-am550-p1-port-with-a-pi/</guid><description>

&lt;/figure>
Although I am the guy with a soldering iron and a bit of software development experience, I am not a fan of the &amp;quot;internet of things&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;smart meters&amp;quot; or smart anything really. Not because I don't like technology, but because of the potential security and privacy problems it brings with it. That said, because of some unfortunate events I now have a smart meter my home. So when life gives you lemons, you make Pi!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've got an &lt;a href="http://www.iskraemeco.com/en/portfolio/electricity-meters/residential-smart-meters/am550/">AM550 Smart meter&lt;/a> with a P1 port. Seeing all the online content and suggestions about reading your smart meter, I decided to have an hour of fun trying to read the P1 data. Here's how I did it:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>The P1 port on the AM550 sends serial data, but the signal is inverted. It is possible to invert that in software, but it is a kludge that requires some &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_banging">bit banging&lt;/a>. Bringing the data in the right polarity and connecting it to the Rx serial input on the GPIO port is the cheapest and fastest way to go if you happen to have an RJ11 connenctor, a PNP transistor and a few resistors lying around. Here are my notes on how I wired the P1 to the Raspberry:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schematic-am550.jpg">&lt;img src="schematic-am550.jpg?w=450" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All that was left is reading the data from the serial port. Pin 10 maps to GPIO15 and happens to also be the Rx pin on the Raspberry Pi's internal Serial adapter, which is available as a device at /dev/ttyAMA0 (I did not choose this pin by accident ;-). I wrote a simple Python script to read the serial port so I could change it to produce munin graphs later:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>When running this program, you should see a whole blob of text scroll by about every second or so. It is readable ASCII and can be parsed by many libraries out there. I tried a few but they were sometimes buggy, or sometimes overengineered and requiring a lot of external resources. So I wrote my own, very crude, parsing. It is not like the meter will be updated every week with new software and ssl certificates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are actually only a few lines in the output that interest me:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Lines starting with &lt;strong>1-0:1.7&lt;/strong> contain the current power usage in Watts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lines starting with &lt;strong>1-0:1.8.1&lt;/strong> are the T1 (low tariff) meter reading in Watt-hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lines starting with &lt;strong>1-0:1.8.2&lt;/strong> are the T2 (high tariff) meter reading in Watt-hours.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>A few lines of additional python gave me three separate munin plugins to produce the graphs I wanted. Here is a nice one showing the power usage of last week, split between high and low tariff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="smartmeter_totals_am550-week.png">&lt;img src="smartmeter_totals_am550-week.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This nice graph also shows one of the problems with smart meters: Given enough resolution, you can see at which times devices and lights are switched on. This can provide some interesting patterns, and enables anybody with access to your meter data to determine when you are home or on vacation. Of course there are some tricks to create constant or confusing usage patterns, I'm sure you'll come up with something smart now that you can see the graphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find all three munin plugins in my &lt;a href="https://github.com/realrolfje/munin-plugins">munin-plugin repository&lt;/a>, in the &amp;quot;plugin&amp;quot; folder. There may also be other interesting stuff there for you munin enthausiasts.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
Suppose you want to provide ssh access to a server or machine without having to change the server configuration for each new user that requires acces, there is a very nice feature in ssh called &amp;quot;SSH Certificates&amp;quot;. This blogpost explains a simple setup to get you started.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;h4 id="creating-the-certificate-authority">Creating the Certificate authority&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>First, create an SSH Certificate keypair. This is a regular public/private key like always, but not used as your default identity (preferably). You can do this on the server, but it is safer to keep this keypair on a separate machine. Keep the private key safe, and give it a strong password:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ca_rsa -C &amp;quot;CA key for example.com&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will generate the file &lt;em>ca_rsa&lt;/em> and &lt;em>ca_rsa.pub&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="adding-the-certificate-authority-to-the-server">Adding the Certificate authority to the server&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>From the certificate authority keypair you just created, take the public key and add the contents of the ca_rsa.pub file to the &lt;em>~/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/em> file of the user account you want to provide access to. Prefix the line with &amp;quot;cert-authority&amp;quot;, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>cert-authority ssh-rsa AAAAB[...]Z04e8c CA key for example.com&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can have multiple lines in the authorized keys if you want, so you can have several SSH Certificates. This enables you to give multiple people the power to sign client keys for scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="signing-a-client-key">Signing a client key&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>To give a client/user access to the account, ask for his public ssh key and sign it. If the user does not yet have a personal keypair, he can create that with&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -C &amp;quot;John Doe&amp;quot;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will produce an &lt;em>~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/em> and &lt;em>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub&lt;/em> file on the user's machine. Ask for the public key, take that the Certificate authority machine and sign the public key:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$ ssh-keygen -s ca_rsa -I &amp;quot;John Doe&amp;quot; id_rsa.pub&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will produce an &lt;em>id_rsa-cert.pub&lt;/em> file. This file needs to be sent back to the user, and needs to be stored in the ~/.ssh folder. If there is already a file with this name, the contents can be appended.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="signing-in">Signing in&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>After all the setup above, the user should be able to connect to the server by just issuing&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$ ssh &amp;lt;servername&amp;gt;&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ssh client will negotiate public/private keypair authentication, and if there is a signature file it will be provided to the server. The server checks the validity of the signature and if it looks ok, it will provice access to the user.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="who-signed-in-and-when">Who signed in and when?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A standard sshd configuration will log all authentication attempts to &lt;em>/var/log/auth&lt;/em>. When a user logs in with a signed public key, the authentication log will list the certificate and the name of the user as provided when signing the key. This way you will be able to tell who logged in, and when.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="but-wait-there-is-more">But wait, there is more!&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>This whole mechanism will enable Raspberry Pi hobbyists with a pretty powerful way to provice access to remote machines without having to add all users to all machines. The SSH Certificate mechanism has more powers than this, please check revocation lists and other cool stuff at &lt;a href="https://ef.gy/hardening-ssh">ef.gy&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Travis CI and Dependabot added to Anonimatron</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2018/04/26/travis-ci-and-dependabot-added-to-anonimatron/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Apr 2018 20:38:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2018/04/26/travis-ci-and-dependabot-added-to-anonimatron/</guid><description>

With new &lt;a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/">European rules like the GDPR&lt;/a> and local variations like the &lt;a href="https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/onderwerpen/avg-nieuwe-europese-privacywetgeving">Dutch AVG&lt;/a>, interest in &lt;a href="https://realrolfje.github.io/anonimatron/">Anonimatron&lt;/a> is increasing. Although I do not keep track of who is using it and where, sometimes new requirements do pop up. Recently a feature was added to &lt;a href="https://github.com/realrolfje/anonimatron/releases">Anonimatron 1.9.2&lt;/a> to also anonymize files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the wake of those additions, I planned to give &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI&lt;/a> a try to automate the builds. It turns out that Travis CI integrates beautifully with GitHub, and automatically builds branches and pull requests right out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the office, we had a discussion about keeping libraries up to date with the maven dependency plugin for our client projects. We came up with a system to use the maven dependency plugin on a separate branch to automatically do that on our buildserver. It turns out that there is a service called &lt;a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot&lt;/a> which does nearly the same thing. Dependabot looks at your GitHub project, and creates &lt;a href="https://github.com/realrolfje/anonimatron/pull/10">pull requests for each library it upgrades&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these services are free for Open Source projects, so Anonimatron would be a great candidate for testing them. I am pretty happy with the way it currently works, and getting this up and running was really simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Make sure your Open Source project builds with any of the main stream build tools supported by Travis CI
like Maven or Gradle. Try to keep the build as simple as possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an account with &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI&lt;/a> with your GitHub account. After registration,
Travis CI shows you a list of your projects. Select one and follow the steps. After a few mouse clicks
Travis CI should be building your project.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an account with &lt;a href="https://dependabot.com/">Dependabot&lt;/a>. As in step 2, select your project and
follow the Dependabot guide to setting it up.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>After a while you should see pull request arriving in your GitHub project, one for each upgraded library.
Travis CI immediately builds those Pull Requests and a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/realrolfje/anonimatron/branches">green tickmark or red cross&lt;/a> shows next to the branch.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There you go, your project now has automatic builds and automatic version upgrades, like a pro. Please note that in order to confidently upgrade libraries, you need to have proper tests! Look at the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/realrolfje/anonimatron/tree/master/src/test/java/com/rolfje/anonimatron">Anonimatron Test Suite&lt;/a>Â to get an idea.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
For a recent experiment I was using &lt;a href="http://www.datasheetarchive.com/BA389-datasheet.html">BA389 PIN diodes&lt;/a> to switch low power RF signals. I was asked why I didn't use an ordinary &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1N4148_signal_diode">1N4148&lt;/a> for that. Since I didn't know what an 1N4148 would do when used like that, and I also didn't really know what a BA389 actually does, I decided to do some measurements.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Aren't diodes rectifiers?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Yes and no. The most basic operation of a diode is to pass current in one way, and block it in the other. But when the diode passes DC current, the internal capacitance lowers, and RF resistance will drop to around 1 Ohm. If you can separate the DC and RF currents, you can switch RF with DC. Most, if not all modern transceivers use PIN diodes to switch the antenna between the internal transmitter and receiver components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>PIN or PN diode?&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_diode">P/N diode&lt;/a> like the 1N4148 only has P and N doped regions. A &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIN_diode">P/I/N diode&lt;/a> has three semiconductor regions with different doping. The I region in a PIN diode makes it a bad/slow rectifier but it a great RF switch, see the provided wikipedia link for more info.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough talk. Let's go. In this case I want to know how a PIN diode like the BA389 compares to an 1N4148 when used for switching RF signals on 145 MHz and 435 MHz. I decided to use my &lt;a href="http://miniradiosolutions.com/54-2/">MiniVNA Tiny&lt;/a> and the following circuit to do the measurements:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="screen-shot-2018-02-23-at-17-31-36.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The output of the MiniVNA Tiny is connected to a 10Â dB attenuator, reducing the -6Â dBm (0.251Â mW) output of the VNA to -16Â dBm (0.025Â mW) hoping to reduce signal leaking around the diode (less signal, less leakage). The output of the attenuator is connected to the AC input on the left side of the schematic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The input of the MiniVNA Tiny is connected to the output of the schematic. Yes, the RF travels through the diode the &amp;quot;wrong way&amp;quot;, against the DC current. This is not an error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The DC input of the circuit is connected to a variable resistor, a multimeter and a power supply to be able to vary the current through the diode (DUT) from 0.001Â mA to 20Â mA.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>&lt;img src="img_6758.jpg"/>&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;img src="img_6767.jpg"/>&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
The coils are 0.35Â mm copper wound 15 turns around a 3Â mm drillbit. The capacitors are SMD to keep everything as short as possible. I also added some extra shielding to separate the in and outputs better.
&lt;p>Before measuring diodes I callibrated the whole setup by having vnaJ measure the &amp;quot;OPEN&amp;quot; characteristics with everything connected but with the diode removed. Then, I soldered a wire in place of the diode and had vnaJ measure the &amp;quot;CLOSED&amp;quot; characteristics. I saved this callibration dataset and used it throughout all other measurements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, I soldered a 1N4148 in place and measured RF Transmission Loss for a number of currents between 0 and 15Â mA. Then I did the same for the BA389. After a bit of fiddling with Excel I produced the following graph of the results:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="screen-shot-2018-02-23-at-21-39-15.png" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The verdict:&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
The results are actually not that bad for the 1N4148. It shows behaviour and comparable linearity to the BA389 PIN diode. The attenuation of the 1N4148 leaves to be desired: -25,5Â dB attenuation compared to -30.3Â dB of the BA389 on 145 MHz. On 435 MHz the difference is a bit bigger: -14.1Â dB vs -20.1Â dB for the BA389. All in all, the 1N4148 is roughly 6 dB more &amp;quot;leaky&amp;quot; than the BA389.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So a 1N4148 actually works as an RF switch, if you are on lower frequencies and don't mind that it only attenuates -25,5Â dB. If you need high performance RF switching with high isolation, particularly at frequencies above 200Â MHz or so I think you're better off selecting a proper PIN diode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the 1N4148 and the BA389 graphs from the MiniVNA Tiny. The graph for the 1N4148 is an earlier one where I didn't have the extra shields. The dip in the 200MHz range is caused by the measurement jig itself. Mind the vertical scales, they don't match. Blue line is Transmission Loss:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.sanquin.nl/donor/bloedverwant/bloedlinks-nummer2/heldenverhaal-joris-welles/">&lt;img src="menselijk-hart-19208136.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&amp;quot;Niertransplantatiefietsen&amp;quot; worden ze onder artsen wel eens genoemd. Tot nu toe had je grote kans dat je de nieren, longen of andere organen van deze gezonde motorrijder had kunnen ontvangen. Zodra ik me mocht registreren heb ik gelijk aangegeven dat ik volledig donor wil zijn. Omdat ik niet geloof in leven na de dood, en wel geloof in het helpen van anderen.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>Er is een groot tekort aan orgaandonoren, of tenminste, aan mensen die niet de moeite nemen om zich te registreren terwijl ze eigenlijk best donor willen zijn. Moeite die ze misschien wel nemen als ze zelf een orgaan nodig zouden hebben. Best raar toch?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pia Dijkstra was het &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vqv6cvi6eR8">met me eens&lt;/a>. Zo kan het niet langer. Ze is in de positie dat ze daar wat aan kan doen en heeft daar hard voor gevochten, en het is haar gelukt. Maar wat mij betreft op een manier die echt niet kan, namelijk: Zonder expliciete toestemming is iedereen orgaandonor. Naast het feit dat niet iedereen zich dat bewust is, denk aan immigranten en mensen die het nieuws niet volgen, worden je nabestaanden op een lastig moment geconfronteerd met het feit dat de regering over je lichaam beslist, of je daar tenminste een lastige vraag over stelt. Ik vind dat een oplossing die een duidelijke grens overschrijdt, en die zelfs in tegenspraak is met &lt;a href="https://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/9353000/1/j9vvihlf299q0sr/vgrnblu821m2">artikel 11 van de Nederlandse grondwet&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ik vind dat een persoon het fundamentele recht heeft zelf te beslissen over zijn eigen lichaam, tot en met &lt;a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euthanasie#Euthanasie_waarbij_de_dood_al_of_niet_op_verzoek_van_de_betrokkene_wordt_veroorzaakt">euthanasie&lt;/a>, zelfs als daar geen ondragelijk lijden aan ten grondslag ligt, zolang je daarmee anderen niet mee in gevaar brengt. Jouw lichaam, jouw keuze. Natuurlijk willen we liever iedereen gezond zien, maar meten daar eigenlijk altijd met twee maten: De ander moet zich goed en gezond gedragen, maar zelf mogen we wel alcohol drinken, te vet eten, roken, en mijn grootste angst en frustratie als motorrijder: &lt;a href="https://nos.nl/artikel/2206162-we-vinden-appen-in-het-verkeer-gevaarlijk-maar-doen-het-zelf-ook.html">appen in de auto&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Je eigen keuzes kunnen voor medische problemen zorgen, en natuurlijk is het goed dat er dan altijd hulp geboden wordt &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YxGgsZMYGCo?t=229">zonder moeilijke vragen&lt;/a>. Onze regering heeft nu geregeld dat we niet alleen medische hulp krijgen, maar ook de organen van mensen &lt;em>die daar misschien nooit mee hebben ingestemd&lt;/em>. En dat is wat mij betreft een stap te ver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hoe dan wel?&lt;/strong>
In Nederland heb je &lt;a href="https://www.overheid.nl/zo-werkt-de-overheid/hoe-werkt-de-democratie/grondwet/">rechten, maar ook plichten&lt;/a>. De leerplicht is daar een goed voorbeeld van, maar ook maar ook het houden aan verkeersregels, de plicht om belasting te betalen en de plicht om als getuige op te treden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Die plichten worden wel door de overheid opgelegd, maar de belastingdienst haalt bijvoorbeeld niet zomaar geld van je rekening. Je kind wordt niet zomaar door een ambtenaar meegenomen en op een willekeurige school gedropt. Er zit geen agent naast je in de auto als je autorijdt. Dat heeft te onder andere te maken met vrijheid. Er wordt in beginsel van uitgegaan dat je zelf je plichten vervult, dat je de sociale druk voelt om dat te doen, en als het dan toch niet lukt is er een controlerende instantie die je benadert als je niet aan je plichten voldoet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In die setting lijkt mij de enige juiste donorwet een wet waarin het vastleggen van de keuze of je orgaandonor wilt zijn verplicht is. Als we iedere Nederlander kunnen benaderen voor het innen van Belasting, af kunnen dwingen om een WA verzekering af te sluiten bij het registreren van een motorvoertuig, kinderen naar school kunnen sturen, kunnen we ze ook een vraag stellen met een verplicht antwoord. Het zou een zinnetje in je belastingformulier kunnen zijn: &amp;quot;Wilt u dit jaar nog orgaandonor zijn ja/nee?&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="orgaandonatie.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wat mij betreft zou het zelfs nog een stapje verder mogen gaan: Ben je geen orgaandonor? Dan ontvang je ook geen organen van andere donoren mocht je die nodig hebben. Misschien zie ik iets over het hoofd, maar dat lijkt me wel zo consistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ik heb nooit geworsteld met mijn donorschap. Als ik overlijd zou ik graag zien dat mijn organen gebruikt worden om mensen te helpen. &lt;a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schenking">Maar de betekenins van &amp;quot;donatie&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;gift&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. Als een inbreker bij mij inbreekt doneer ik geen TV aan hem, dan steelt hij die. Dus mevrouw Dijkstra en al de parlementariers die zelf geen donor waren maar wel voor de wet hebben gestemd maken het mij moeilijk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Voorlopig heb ik mijn donorschap even ingetrokken. Niet omdat ik geen donor wil zijn, maar als signaal. Omdat ik het hartgrondig oneens ben met de gekozen oplossing die een stap maakt naar een samenleving waar niet jij, maar de regering over je lichaam beschikt.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="bandpassfilter.gif" alt="">
Building a receiver for a voice repeater system in this area I set up a &lt;a href="https://www.thumbsat.com/thumbnet-radios">thumbsat receiver&lt;/a> connected to a Raspberry Pi. The receiver is part of the repeater system to widen it's receiving range. However, the performance turned out not to be too optimal. I guessed that the GSM and Wifi signals around here could cause the RTL2832U to overload, so I decided to build an intedigital bandpassfilter using &lt;a href="http://www.changpuak.ch/electronics/interdigital_bandpass_filter_designer.php">Ajarn Changpuak&lt;/a>'s excelent interdigital bandpass filter calculator.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>Because size was an issue and the GSM and Wifi bands are not very close to the receive frequency, I decided on a 2 element filter with 8MHz passband and 0.2dB ripple. Playing with the calculator got me the following filter dimensions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
Length interior Element : 54.54 mm or 2.147 inch
Length of end Element : 54.72 mm or 2.154 inch
Ground plane space : 20 mm or 0.787 inch
Rod Diameter : 4 mm or 0.157 inch
End plate to center of Rod : 10 mm or 0.394 inch
Tap to shorted End : 1.41 mm or 0.055 inch&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**** Dimensions, mm (inch) ****&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="end-to-center-center-center-gk-qcoup">End to Center Center-Center G[k] Q/Coup&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>0 0.00 (0.000)
1 10.00 (0.394) 35.97 (1.416) 1.038 0.714
2 45.97 (1.810) 0.00 (0.000) 0.675 1.738
3 55.97 (2.204)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**** Box inside dimensions ****
Height : 59.00 mm or 2.323 inch
Length : 55.97 mm or 2.204 inch
Depth : 20.00 mm or 0.787 inch
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I discovered later, forgetting to refresh the calculations one last time resulted in incorrect dimentions (yes, the dimensions are incorrect in the list above).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I built the filter with blank PCB sheet and brass rods I had lying around. The first version looked like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img_6332.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without the top screwed it performed beautifully, but that turned out to be coincedence. Closing the filter up showed some strange characteristicts and the passband was on a much lower frequency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used my &lt;a href="http://miniradiosolutions.com/54-2/">miniVNA Tiny&lt;/a> to look at the characteristics while fiddling with it. To make it work I used copper shielding of an RG213 cable to close the filter properly, connected the inside and outside copper on the PCB, and added two solid wires to create a stronger coupling and changing the frequency. A bit unconventional and structuraly unsound, but it worked, and it ended up looking like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![](img_6400-small.jpg)
](img_6400-small.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![](img_6413-small.jpg)
](img_6413-small.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
The electrical performance is adequate enough, and a short test confirmed that the RTL2832U has a much better performance, even with the additional 1.3 dB insertion loss of the filter:
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![](1270-mhz-bandpass-s12.png?w=150)

&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![](img_6489-crop.jpg)
](img_6489-crop.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
The receiver with the bandpass filter is installed on the roof and is performing nicely.
&lt;p>It still felt strange that the filter does not behave as designed so I returned to Ajarn Changpuak's page to re-check my calculations and it turned out to be incorrect. The correct dimensions would have been:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
Length interior Element : 54.53 mm or 2.147 inch
Length of end Element : 54.72 mm or 2.154 inch
Ground plane space : 20 mm or 0.787 inch
Rod Diameter : 4 mm or 0.157 inch
End plate to center of Rod : 10 mm or 0.394 inch
Tap to shorted End : 1.78 mm or 0.070 inch&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**** Dimensions, mm (inch) ****&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="end-to-center-center-center-gk-qcoup-1">End to Center Center-Center G[k] Q/Coup&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>0 0.00 (0.000)
1 10.00 (0.394) 32.98 (1.298) 1.038 0.714
2 42.98 (1.692) 0.00 (0.000) 0.675 1.738
3 52.98 (2.086)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**** Box inside dimensions ****
Height : 59.00 mm or 2.323 inch
Length : 52.98 mm or 2.086 inch
Depth : 20.00 mm or 0.787 inch
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Aha. This explains it. After re-calculating, the rods should have been closer together and the tap to the shorted end should have been further from the casing. I guess I have to re-do this filter with the correct dimensions some time. After this adventure I'm fairly confident that I can get it to behave nicely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>JSON alerts for Munin</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2018/01/07/json-alerts-for-munin/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Jan 2018 18:18:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2018/01/07/json-alerts-for-munin/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/54568">&lt;img src="munin-log.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Munin is a great and easy way to monitor your servers. The documentation for Munin is kind of all over the place, and sometimes not all that clear.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * There is the recent [&amp;quot;Munin Guide&amp;quot;](https://munin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which is quite informative and well laid out.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Sometimes additional info and background can be found on the &lt;a href="http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/Documentation">old munin wiki&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Getting the standard mail alerts working on munin is simplest, but as soon as you want custom layouts or send alerts as a push message to a phone, it can take quite some work. Here's what I figured out to get the Munin alert available to you as JSON inside your own Python script so you can do anything you want with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>On the munin master, create the file &lt;code>/etc/munin/munin-conf.d/alerts.conf&lt;/code> with the following contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;]
contact.python.command /etc/munin/scripts/alert.py
contact.python.text { &amp;quot;group&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:group}&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;host&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:host}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;graph_category&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:graph_category}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;graph_title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:graph_title}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;warning&amp;quot;:[ &lt;br>
${loop&amp;lt;,&amp;gt;:wfields {&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:label}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:value}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:wrange}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:crange}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:extinfo}&amp;quot;} }&lt;br>
],&lt;br>
&amp;quot;critical&amp;quot;:[ &lt;br>
${loop&amp;lt;,&amp;gt;:cfields {&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:label}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:value}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:wrange}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:crange}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:extinfo}&amp;quot;} }&lt;br>
],&lt;br>
&amp;quot;unknown&amp;quot;:[ &lt;br>
${loop&amp;lt;,&amp;gt;:ufields {&amp;quot;label&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:label}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;value&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:value}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;w&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:wrange}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;c&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:crange}&amp;quot;,&lt;br>
&amp;quot;extra&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;${var:extinfo}&amp;quot;} }&lt;br>
]&lt;br>
}
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will make Munin output JSON to the &amp;quot;python&amp;quot; user, you can chose another name if needed. After this, you can create a Python script looking somewhat like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; language=&amp;quot;python&amp;quot;]
#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="heading">&lt;/h1>

&lt;h1 id="chmod-x-etcmuninscriptsalertpy">chmod +x /etc/munin/scripts/alert.py&lt;/h1>
&lt;h1 id="heading-1">&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>import sys

import json&lt;/p>
&lt;p>def humanreadable( jsonalert ):
hascritical = (len(jsonalert['critical']) &amp;gt; 0)
haswarning = (len(jsonalert['warning']) &amp;gt; 0)
hasunknown = (len(jsonalert['unknown']) &amp;gt; 0)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>report = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if hascritical:
for i in jsonalert['critical']:
report += &amp;quot;CRITICAL: {0} {1}: {2}={3}&amp;quot;.format(jsonalert['host'],
jsonalert['graph_title'], i['label'],i['value'])&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if haswarning:
for i in jsonalert['warning']:
report += &amp;quot;WARNING: {0} {1}: {2}={3}&amp;quot;.format(jsonalert['host'],
jsonalert['graph_title'], i['label'],i['value'])&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if hasunknown:
for i in jsonalert['unknown']:
report += &amp;quot;UNKNOWN: {0} {1}: {2}={3}&amp;quot;.format(jsonalert['host'],
jsonalert['graph_title'], i['label'],i['value'])&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if hascritical + haswarning + hasunknown == 0:
report += &amp;quot;OK: {0} {1}&amp;quot;.format(jsonalert['host'],jsonalert['graph_title'])&lt;/p>
&lt;p>return report&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="get-the-output-from-munin-stdout-and-print-it">Get the output from Munin stdout and print it.&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>for line in sys.stdin:
j = json.loads(line)
readable = humanreadable(j)
print readable
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is no debugging without testruns. To see if this works, you can run this command:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; language=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]
sudo -u munin /usr/share/munin/munin-limits --force
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This should give you output which looks somewhat like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot;]
WARNING: monitor.local Logged in users: pts=4.00

[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bingo! Munin sends JSON to your Python script! Now you can use your awesome Pyhton skills to change this into whatever you want or send. To get you inspired, here's a piece of code I use to send alerts to a Mattermost server:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; language=&amp;quot;python&amp;quot;]
import requests&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mattermost_url = &amp;quot;https://&lt;your-server-here>/hooks/&lt;your-hook-here>&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>def sendmattermost( alerts ):
payload = '{&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Monitor&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;text&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;'&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if &amp;quot;WARNING:&amp;quot; in alerts or &amp;quot;CRITICAL:&amp;quot; in alerts:
payload += ':rotating_light:\n'
else:
payload += &amp;quot;:pager:\n&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>payload += alerts
payload += '&amp;quot;}'&lt;/p>
&lt;p>print &amp;quot;Sending payload: '&amp;quot; + payload +&amp;quot;'.&amp;quot;
r = requests.post(mattermost_url, data=payload)
if r.status_code != 200:
print &amp;quot;PANIC &amp;quot; + r.reason +&amp;quot; : &amp;quot; + r.text
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="delete-or-leave.jpg">&lt;img src="delete-or-leave.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Users of Mattermost have probably noticed the less-than-optimal interface design where de Delete option is right above the Leave option in the Channel menu. On a busy server, you can imagine having quite a few incidents where people accidentally completely delete a channel.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the Open Source version of Mattermost, everybody van do anything, because there is &lt;a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/6320">no sensible security model with roles&lt;/a>. Mattermost Inc. seems to think that the Open Source community is &lt;a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/6320#issuecomment-302996954">not entitled to roles&lt;/a>, which I (and others with me) strongly disagree with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/realrolfje/mattermost-platform">Forking Mattermost&lt;/a>, learning Golang and enabeling security, improving &lt;a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/6321">a few other issues&lt;/a> for the open source community along the way is a plan. But there is a simpler workaround for people running Mattermost inside &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">Nginx&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Restart nginx with the command &lt;em>&amp;quot;service nginx restart&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. After this modification, nobody can delete a channel. Crude but effective. If you have tips on how to parse the headers with nginx to allow certain users to access the DELETE methods, please let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background:&lt;/strong>
We run a chat server for (mostly Dutch) licensed HAM radio operators on our own &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMPRNet">44.x.x.x network segment&lt;/a> of the internet also known in the Netherlands as &lt;a href="https://www.hamnet.nl/">&amp;quot;hamnet&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. We wanted a modern chat service with mobile applications to spice up the HAM radio world, ping eachother on field days, share thoughts and links to information, and enable colaboration for the growing number &lt;a href="https://github.com/travisgoodspeed/md380tools">HAM radio programmers&lt;/a> working on &lt;a href="https://freedv.org/">open source&lt;/a> software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The server is paid for and run by people who care about sharing. Although Mattermost is not our focus area, we do try to contribute to Mattermost with bug reports, &lt;a href="https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/pull/176">fixes&lt;/a> and running the beta chat clients. Our usergroup is almost 500 people, and growing. Depending on events or contests roughly 20% of our users are actively reading and contributing to one or more channels:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >

&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![](mattermost_sessions_hobbyscoop-week.png)
](mattermost_sessions_hobbyscoop-week.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
Mattermost did mention their ["monday license program"](https://about.mattermost.com/mattermost-mondays/) in their responses, but as you can see we are already halfway their 1000 user limit and growing. We have no intention of sending any legal documents or statutes to a company which then decides if we can access our own existing content.
&lt;p>From where we are standing, with the open source tools we use, Mattermost looks like an odd duck. Most of the open source tools we use and contribute to have common-sense safety and security built in, Linux, nginx, &lt;a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">haproxy&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">letsencrypt&lt;/a>Â  being a few strong examples. In contrast, the Mattermost team cripples the Open Source version with &lt;a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server/issues/5935">weak passwords&lt;/a> and no implementation of even the most basic security roles. For a tool which pretends to be mature and safe enough to be exposed to the Internet, the workaround as described in this blogpost should not be needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please help us convince the Mattermost Team of the importance of security in all versions of their products. Making money with support and features is okay, but basic common sense security should be the default for any open source project. We even think that improving security and speed makes Mattermost a more viable competitor against Slack and Telegram, to name two.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0IRvtw22JIc">&lt;img src="b1262-0.jpg" alt="Surprise video">
&lt;/a>The default serial speed on the ESP8266 WiFi chip is 115200 baud. If you connect this chip to an Arduino and want to use SoftSerial to talk to it, it will not work. The SoftSerial library is limited to 9600 baud because of hardware limitations of the Arduino. If you want to talk to the ESP8266 with an Arduino at lower speeds, you need to tell the ESP8266 to slow down.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[Remco.org](http://remco.org/) noted that sending 115200 baud with SoftSerial works just well enough to throw a command to the ESP8266. So below is a sketch that will do just that for you.
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Load or copy/paste the sketch in your Arduino IDE.
2. Connect the ESP8266 board to the Arduino as follows:
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ESP TX pin to Arduino softRX pin 4&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ESP RX pin to Arduino softTx pin 5
3. Open the Serial Monitor of the Arduino IDE and set it to 9600 bps and CR/LF.
4. Compile and upload this sketch to theÂ  Arduino.
5. Wait for the Serial monitor to show:
AT
OK
-- Sketch stopped.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can now use your ESP8266 at 9600 baud. The setting is stored in non-volatile memory, so you only need to do this once.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here's the sketch:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;cpp&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
/*&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>This sketch switches the ESP8266 from its&lt;/li>

&lt;li>communicate with it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BweBCNBxJxM">&lt;img src="keychain-mac-tuto.png" alt="keychain-mac-tuto">
&lt;/a>If you used DSA keys to log in to your SSH server and have upgraded your client machine to macOS Sierra (or OSX Sierra if you like), you probably ran into this problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh -p 8123 &lt;a href="mailto:george@10.0.0.10">george@10.0.0.10&lt;/a> -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa
Permission denied (publickey).
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this problem is replacing the DSA key with an RSA key, but how do you do on the server when your only means for connecting is the OSX client machine you just upgraded? Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First, create a new 4096 bit RSA keypair on the local machine (don't delete your DSA keys yet!). Don't use anything less than 4096 bits, and protect it with a lengthy passphrase. This key will replace the DSA key later on.
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:OA3Vx8qb4kKRWYs8qsq5/EywaLLdwZdlCIITFPnRtt8 &lt;a href="mailto:george@macbook.local">george@macbook.local&lt;/a>
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|ooo . .. . |
| + . o .. . o |
|o o +.o= o o |
| . o oB=. o |
| . .=oS o |
|. o.. .&lt;em>.Eo |
|oo oo.o. . |
|=o=. o. . |
|o&lt;/em>+o. . |
+----[SHA256]-----+
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don't worry about that long passphrase, Sierra now &lt;a href="https://personalresearchblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/28/macos-sierra-ssh-key-passphrase-and-the-keychain/">stores that in your Keychain&lt;/a>. Now, log into your server by temporarily enabling ssh-dss public key support on the ssh command line, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh -p 8123 &lt;a href="mailto:george@10.0.0.10">george@10.0.0.10&lt;/a> -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa &lt;br>
-o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If all went well, you should now be connected to your server, but with your old DSA key. The DSA support was disabled in Sierra because it is &lt;a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5096/rsa-vs-dsa-for-ssh-authentication-keys#5100">no longer considered to be a safe option&lt;/a> as it is based on the discrete logarithm problem and the key is required to be just 1024 bits long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we need to do now is remove the DSA public key from the server and add the newly created RSA key. Start your editor with:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
server$ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find the old DSA public key, remove it. Add the contents of the &lt;code>id_rsa.pub&lt;/code> on your client machine to this file on the server. Save the file with &lt;code>&amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;:wq&amp;lt;enter&amp;gt;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now exit the server and reconnect with your new RSA key from the client:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
server$ exit
client$ ssh -p 8123 &lt;a href="mailto:george@10.0.0.10">george@10.0.0.10&lt;/a> -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should now see the welcome message from the server and the command prompt. Please note that the -i option is here for clarity; if your key is in &lt;code>~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code> it will be used as default identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If everything worked, please delete the id_dsa key to prevent confusion. All operations should now be back to normal (but safer).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus 1: Tab-completion for SSH&lt;/strong>
If you are tired of typing the long ssh commands and remembering ip addresses and key files, create a file called &lt;code>~/.ssh/config&lt;/code> and give it the following contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-super-secret-server">My Super secret server&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Host secret-server
HostName 10.0.0.1
Port 8123
User george
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saving the file, you can use tab completion after the ssh command, and you will notice that the following command will work:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh secret-server
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus 2: Per-server identity&lt;/strong>
With the powers of the config file mentioned earlier, there is no longer a reason to have one key file or one userid per server. Suppose somebody accidentally gets a hold of a key file, or someone figures out a way to find a key for a bunch of packets between two machines. This would mean immediate compromise of all machines. Because there is no extra effort in using multiple keys, I use a new private key for each server. My &lt;code>~/.ssh/config&lt;/code> file looks similar to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-super-secret-server-1">My Super secret server&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Host secret-server
HostName 10.0.0.1
Port 8123
User george
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_george_secret_rsa&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-dmz-firewall">The DMZ firewall&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Host dmz-firewall
HostName 10.0.0.21
Port 8623
User jack
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jack_dmz_fw_rsa
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because just like passwords, I never use the same private key twice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Designing a Fox-hunt antenna</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2016/06/19/designing-a-fox-hunt-antenna/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2016 21:47:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2016/06/19/designing-a-fox-hunt-antenna/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="3d-radiation-pattern.png">&lt;img src="3d-radiation-pattern.png" alt="3d radiation pattern">
&lt;/a>Many years ago, I used to do some &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rrNXyv134bE">radio fox hunting with cars&lt;/a>. Usually these hunts are at night to make it more exciting, and can be great fun. As I got older I lost interest and moved on to other things. But last year, I decided to have a go at a &lt;a href="http://www.ballonvossenjacht.nl">popular balloon fox hunt&lt;/a> on 144MHz. This is quite a large scale &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QrDOEXb_ss">and professionally organized fox hunt&lt;/a> by Dutch Radio Amateurs.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of the totally different setup and frequency I decided to join a few recreational 144MHz (2 meter) fox hunts to get the hang of it. If you like to play with radios and walk in the woods, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDN8w7awAkQ">this is your thing&lt;/a>. Lots of small transmitters hidden in the bushes on random frequencies for you to find.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last year I used a borrowed receiver and antenna, and this year I decided to build a &lt;a href="http://www.peildoos.nl/?page_id=128">Foxbox receiver kit&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After building the receiver, the age-old discussion among radio amateurs began: What antenna to use? I had a discussion with Remco who just designed his own &lt;a href="http://remco.org/index.php/2015/02/26/145-mhz-2m-moxon-pt-2/">Moxon antenna&lt;/a> using the &lt;a href="http://www.qsl.net/4nec2/">4nec2 antenna modeler and optimizer&lt;/a>. He convinced me to use this software in order to prevent building a lot of failing antennas and not being sure why they fail. So that's what I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 4nec2 software comes with a bunch of example antennas for you to play around with. The antenna I borrowed last year was a 2 element antenna based on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-periodic_antenna">Log Periodic Dipole Array antenna&lt;/a>. It worked fine and I had fun with it so I decided to model an antenna like that. (Also because I'm hard-headed and just copying Remco's Moxon would not lead to interesting discussions).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: Getting basic dimensions of an LPDA&lt;/strong>
The first thing I needed is a basic, ballpark approximation of a working LPDA antenna for 144MHz so I could get used to the 4nec2 modeling software. I used &lt;a href="http://hamwaves.com/lpda/en/">ON4AA's Log-Periodic Dipole Array calculator&lt;/a> to get an idea of the basic dimensions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I noticed that the length of the first and largest element of the antenna is always 1041 mm, no matter what taper or relative spacing I chose as input. Good news, because that means that the antenna only has a few parameters to change when optimizing in 4nec2, see below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: Getting the design into 4nec2&lt;/strong>
So here is where the struggle starts. As I am a Mac user and the 4nec2 software is Windows only, I installed it on a Linux Mint virtual machine running under Wine without problems. The terminal window will log errors but you have to put your OCD aside for a moment and ignore those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the LPDA antenna itself the struggle was not that bad, as I found an example file and was able to change that around to learn how 4nec2 works. I'll spare you the details. Just remember that you want to use the new NEC editor (Main Window, Settings â NEC Editor (new)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="1-editor.png">&lt;img src="1-editor.png" alt="4nec2 Editor">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here you see the two wires of my LPDA antenna. As you can see, each line has a start (X1,Y1,Z1) and end point (X2,Y2,Z2) in 3D space. Ignore the funny formulas in the screenshot for now. A counter intuitive thing for me was that lines are made out of &amp;quot;segments&amp;quot;. 4nec2 cryptically complains about too few and too much segments, and you have to choose a number accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important thing to learn about 4nec2 is that you don't &amp;quot;connect&amp;quot; a source to your antenna. Rather, you choose a segment of a line which will then act as a current or voltage source (current source is the recommended default). This is why if you want to have your feed point in the middle of a wire, you need to choose an odd number of segments. In my design, both wires are 61 segments, and the feed point on both wires is on segment 31 (the middle segment of each wire).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Connecting the two wires of the antenna is done using a transmission line, with a twist (literally). We connect segment 31 of both wires with a transmission line, and chose a &lt;em>negative impedance&lt;/em>. This causes the transmission line to &amp;quot;twist&amp;quot; in your geometry window, and you should see something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="2-geometry.png">&lt;img src="2-geometry.png" alt="LPDA Geometry">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: Changing the NEC file for optimization&lt;/strong>
4nec2 contains an optimizer which can optimize certain characteristics of your antenna by iterating values. If you hard-coded the X,Y and Z values of the lines, the optimizer can not change the design. To be able to use the optimizer, I chose to have variables for the length of the boom (L), length of the driving/smallest element (D), length of the reflecting/longest element (R) and impedance of the transmission line (TRI). This explains the funny values for the X,Y,Z coordinates in my file. The variables can be found on the &amp;quot;Symbols&amp;quot; tab of the NEC editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 4: Optimize!&lt;/strong>
Close the Editor window, and in the main window, select Calculate -&amp;gt; Start Optimizer. The optimizer parameters can be a bit confusing. Choose the &amp;quot;Optimize&amp;quot; function in the drop-down top left, and leave the Option set to &amp;quot;default&amp;quot;. Below the text &amp;quot;Weighting factors in %&amp;quot; you'll see 7 text fields. Set them all to 0, except for &amp;quot;F/B&amp;quot;, the Front-to-back ratio. That should be set to 100, As we are only interested in maximum directivity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="3-optimizer.png">&lt;img src="3-optimizer.png?w=450" alt="Optimizer">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we have told 4nec2 what we want (max F/B), we need to tell the optimizer which variables it can play with. In this simple design, you could select all variables by clicking on them, which moves them to the &amp;quot;selected&amp;quot; column. I tried, this does not lead to practical results and takes a bit of time depending on the speed of the computer. All open geometry or 3D view windows will live-update with the calculations. This looks really cool but things go faster if you close them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="3a-optimized-radiation.png">&lt;img src="3a-optimized-radiation.png" alt="Optimized radiation">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a bit of playing with the optimizer, I got to the following radiation pattern:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="4-radiation-pattern.png">&lt;img src="4-radiation-pattern.png" alt="4. radiation pattern">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 5. Build and field test.&lt;/strong>
At this point, the software will have tried tens, if not hundreds of different antenna variations you didn't have to physically build. But now that we are &amp;quot;certain&amp;quot;, we can build the antenna. The boom is aluminum profile, the radials are made of measuring tape so they can be folded, and the handle is a broomstick:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="5-antenne.jpg">&lt;img src="5-antenne.jpg" alt="Antenna">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've spent extra effort to make sure the dimensions are as close to the simulation as possible, to maximize the chance that it actually works as designed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did a field test together with my dad, where we used a Baofeng handheld (yes &lt;a href="https://rolfje.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/better-modulation-for-the-baofeng-uv-5ra/">that one&lt;/a>) as a &amp;quot;fox&amp;quot;, taking turns in hiding it for the each other. The tests went &amp;quot;sort of okay&amp;quot;, but I noticed that it sometimes felt as if there was not one peak straight in front of the antenna, but rather two peaks left and right. This got me worrying about the accuracy of the build or the simulation. I even started doubting impact of impedance mismatch and cable length. When we got home however, I checked and saw that the 4nec2 software actually predicted this in a different diagram:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="6-vertical-radiation.png">&lt;img src="6-vertical-radiation.png" alt="Vertical radiation">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out, that if the antenna is held horizontally, and the transmitter antenna is a vertical, the whole system behaves exactly as simulated, with the antenna being almost &amp;quot;deaf&amp;quot; right in front of the boom. Solution: Turn the antenna vertical or horizontal while hunting to find the maximum signal. We noticed that without being able to see the radio, I could exactly match the angle of the vertical antenna. My dad hid the fox in a tree at 45 degrees, and without seeing or knowing it I matched the angle of the antenna perfectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 6. Game on!&lt;/strong>
Just today I tried the whole setup in an actual fox hunt with 24 foxes (yes that many). I was very pleased with the performance of the antenna, and I found 14 of the foxes. With a bit of practice and experience, I'm sure I can improve to find more foxes next time around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And last but not least, here is the 4nec2 file for you to play around with:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06N-5aUaV9w">&lt;img src="100-1015-bnc-t-connector.jpg" alt="100-1015 BNC T Connector">
&lt;/a>Ever wondered how well your 50Î© coaxial cable is working? If you have a reasonably fast oscilloscope, preferably up to 100MHz and a signal generator which can generate short bursts, you can measure not only the length of your cable, but also the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_loss">return loss&lt;/a> at a certain frequency. From that, we can learn the attenuation of the cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post describes the classic time domain reflection measurement using the following setup:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="tdr-measurement.png" alt="Measuring TDR">&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->The generator on the left generates a pulse or signal which travels down the cable. This signal is called $latex U_i$, the incident wave. Because the end of the cable at the right is open, there can be no current, and the wave has to travel back to the left. This wave is called $latex U_r$, the reflected wave. When the reflected wave hits the generator, it will disappear into the 50Î© impedance of the generator.
&lt;p>When the wave travels through the cable and back, it encounters resistance and inductance of the copper, and capacitance towards the shielding. If we can measure the returning waveform, we can say something about the cable loss.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To measure $latex U_i$ and $latex U_r$ we need to use a 10x signal probe so that we influence the signal as little as possible. If we would use a 1x signal probe, the load of the probe will make it look like our cable has quite a bit of loss. In reality, it will be the probe that is influencing the measurement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It takes the signal a certain time to travel through the cable. In a vacuum, the signal travels at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity">speed of light&lt;/a>. In a cable, the signal actually travels &lt;em>slower&lt;/em>. Different cables have different speeds. The manufacturer of the cable provides this speed as a factor relative to the speed of light, called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor">&amp;quot;velocity factor&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. If we know the velocity factor of the cable, and the time the signal took to return, we can say something about its length.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm using an &lt;a href="http://owonchina.en.made-in-china.com/product/XKrECsfAHmUj/China-OWON-50MHz-Dual-Channel-Modulated-Waveform-Generator-AG2052F-.html">OWON AG2052&lt;/a> function generator, and have set it up to generate a &amp;quot;burst&amp;quot;. A 25MHz sinewave, 2 cycles. The voltage is not really important, anywhere from 1 to 5 Volts makes the measurement comfortable, well above the noise floor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_1964.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1964.jpg" alt="IMG_1964">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The signal generator is connected through an RG58 cable and a BNC T-connector to the coax we're testing, in this case a few meters of &lt;a href="http://www.hamshop.com/ecoflex-15-coax-kabels.html">Ecoflex 15&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember those funny little springy things you received with your new 10x 100MHz probes? This is a nice example of how to use them:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_1972.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1972.jpg" alt="Proper Probing">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If everything went well, you should see $latex U_i$ and $latex U_r$ on your oscilloscope screen. To make an accurate measurement, stretch them out big enough so they just fit the screen of the scope. Since I'm measuring the peak voltage, I don't need the lower part of the wave. Using your scope like this makes better use of your A/D converter resolution, and uses more pixels on the screen, which means better accuracy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="25mhz-2cycles.png">&lt;img src="25mhz-2cycles.png?w=450" alt="25MHz-2cycles">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cursor A and B are on the top of the second sine of $latex U_i$ and $latex U_r$. I could also have used the first, it doesn't really matter. The first sine is higher because of a little overshoot in the generator. We see that $latex U_{i (peak)}=654mV$ and $latex U_{r (peak)}=578mV$. To calculate the loss from these two voltages, we use the formula we found for calculating return loss from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_coefficient">reflection coefficient&lt;/a> $latex \Gamma$ (gamma):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$latex RL_{(db)}=-20 \times \log_{10}\left(\Gamma \right)$ where $latex \Gamma =\frac{U_r}{U_i}$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Which means that in our case:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$latex RL_{(db)}=-20 \times \log_{10}\left(\frac{0.578}{0.654} \right)=-1.073dB$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We're interested in attenuation, the cable loss one-way, so we need to devide the return loss by two:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$latex \frac{-1.073}{2}=-0.54dB$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This attenuation is meaningless without knowing the length of the cable. To be able to calculate the length, we must know how fast the signal is traveling in the cable. According to the manufacturer, the velocity factor of Ecoflex 15 is 0.86. This means that a signal in this cable travels at 0.86 times the light speed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$latex 299,792,458 \times 0.86=257,821,513.9:^m/_s$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cursors A and B are 270nS apart. This means that the signal traveled&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$latex 257,821,513.9 \times 270 \times 10^{-9}=69.61, m$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is of course twice the length of the cable, so our cable is &lt;strong>34.8 meter&lt;/strong> long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we know the length and the loss of our cable, we can compare it with the manufacturer's specifications. The specifications of Ecoflex 15 say that the typical attenuation is 0.86dB per 100m at 10MHz, and 1.96dB per 100m at 50MHz. Lets assume that the attenuation is linear with the frequency between those two. The attenuation on 25MHz should be approximately 1.3dB per 100m.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have a cable of 34.8 meter with 0.54dB attenuation, so per 100 meter that would be:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$latex \frac{100}{34.8} \times -0.54=-1.5,dB$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's about 15% worse than the specification, but this can be easily explained by inaccuracies in our measurement, the resolution of the oscilloscope, and loss in cables and plugs. When repeating this measurement on my setup it's easy to see variations of 20% in the results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What if your generator is slower&lt;/strong>
When your generator can not do short bursts, or can't generate a high enough frequency, you can at least measure the cable length by sending a square wave down the line. This is the most common measurement to do, but doesn't give you much information about the attenuation on a certain frequency. The frequency of the square wave does not matter much, as long as the edges have a decent rise time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="square-wave.png">&lt;img src="square-wave.png?w=450" alt="Square wave">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this measurement you see $latex U_i$ on the left, then a period where the reflected $latex U_r$ is added to $latex U_i$, and then the last part of the $latex U_r$. The length of the first &amp;quot;Step&amp;quot; is the length of your cable, and the difference between $latex U_i$ and $latex U_r$ is your DC resistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another possibility is that your generator can generate a burst, but not short enough. You can then still do both the return loss and cable length measurements, but it will look a bit different.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="25mhz-20cycles.png">&lt;img src="25mhz-20cycles.png?w=450" alt="25MHz-20cycles">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here, the middle section where $latex U_i$ and $latex U_r$ are added should not be interpreted in any way. Depending on the length of the cable, and the phase of $latex U_r$ you can even see a lower signal here, where $latex U_r$ cancels out $latex U_i$. Only use the first and last parts of the signal,indicated with $latex U_i$ and $latex U_r$ above.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Gotchas:
**Pay attention to more than one reflection: If there is more than one reflection, your generator is not the same impedance of the cable. I made the mistake of adding a 50Î© terminator at the generator side. But since the generator was already 50Î©, I created a 25Î© impedance, which reflected $latex U_r$ and sent it back into the cable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also make sure you always measure an open ended cable. If an antenna is connected, the reflection measurement will work, but the return loss can not be determined. After all, the antenna is made to dissipate energy, and we don't know how much energy is lost in the cable, and how much is lost in the antenna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun experimenting,
Rolf&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g">&lt;img src="lady-justice.gif" alt="lady justice">
&lt;/a>However I disagree with sites like Ashley Madison and the way its owners scam people, last week I have noticed something far more disturbing. As I understand, Ashley Madison was charging people for their profiles to be deleted, and then did not (promptly) delete them. I guess some of it's &amp;quot;hackers&amp;quot; got caught up in this and decided to attack Ashley Madison for that. Up to this point, merely a quarrel between two parties which may have better been solved by legal procedure.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->But when the "hackers" get hold of the user database of Ashley Madison things become interesting. The "hackers" threaten to release all the data they took from Ashley Madison. A few days later they actually release all the personal data, conveniently cleaned of their own records. Of course the never sleeping internet sleezeballs make it searchable, immediately turning it into a disproportionate problem for a number of people:
&lt;p>&lt;a href="cm0fb3yuyaazsi8.png">&lt;img src="cm0fb3yuyaazsi8.png" alt="CM0Fb3yUYAAZSi8">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/srhbutts">@srhbutts&lt;/a> eloquently responds:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>Indiscriminate, bulk release of sensitive, illegally obtained data is not justifiable. Ever. Don't celebrate this.&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>What the &amp;quot;hackers&amp;quot; did is terrorize and &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/24/toronto-suicides-ashley-madison-hack">destroy the lives&lt;/a> of people they've never met, simply because those people did not live up to their ideas and standards. To me, that is exactly what every terrorist organization does. Yes, that one too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even more terrifying is that instead of condemning the &amp;quot;hackers&amp;quot;, the media and its brainwashed bloodthirsty audience feedsÂ on the datadump without so much as a thought about what just happened. A large number of people fall in to the confirmation bias trap where they just define anyone which can be remotely linked to that datadump as guilty of moral sins. And still, nobody seems to notice that the data dump conveniently contains no personal data of the &amp;quot;hackers&amp;quot; themselves. Remember, that's how this all started, didn't it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole thing has turned into a classic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g">witch hunt&lt;/a>, where a large group of people vilifies random strangers without trial or evidence simply because they find that person's actions strange or unbecoming. Today, it's called &lt;a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/7/30/9074865/cecil-lion-palmer-mob-justice">&amp;quot;Mob Justice&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, but it is in essence exactly the same.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Social) media is not a replacement for a judicial system, for very good reasons. If you think someone committed a crime, talk to the police about it. [Update: Or talk to Ashley Madison if you have info about the &amp;quot;hackers&amp;quot; and &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/ashley-madison-offering-500k-reward-info-hackers/">get a $500k reward&lt;/a>]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Destroying random people's lives simply because you don't understand or agree with their ways is dumb, medieval and in modern words plain terrorism.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving the JAXB "unexpected element" problem</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2015/06/08/solving-the-jaxb-unexpected-element-problem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jun 2015 21:43:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2015/06/08/solving-the-jaxb-unexpected-element-problem/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="1.jpg">&lt;img src="1.jpg?w=135" alt="-1">
&lt;/a>If you are using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Architecture_for_XML_Binding">JAXB&lt;/a> in a maven/java project to unmarshal an XML document and you get:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException: unexpected element (uri:"urn:iso:std:somestuff:xsd:somestuff", local:"Document"). Expected elements are (none)&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Or if you are using JAXB to marshal an XML document and you get:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>com.sun.istack.internal.SAXException2: unable to marshal type "generated.somestuff.Document" as an element because it is missing an @XmlRootElement annotation&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>You have probably fallen victim of the fact that JAXB does not do &amp;quot;Simple Binding&amp;quot; by default. If your project is a maven project and you generated classes based on an xsd file, this is how you fix it (without changing the xsd file):&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Tell JAXB to do "simple binding". To do so, create a binding file called src/main/resources/jaxb/simple-binding.xml with the following contents:
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot;]
&amp;lt;jaxb:bindings jaxb:extensionBindingPrefixes=&amp;quot;xjc&amp;quot; version=&amp;quot;2.1&amp;quot;
xmlns:jaxb=&amp;quot;http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb&amp;quot;

&lt;a href="jaxb:globalBindings">jaxb:globalBindings&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="xjc:simple/">xjc:simple/&lt;/a>
&amp;lt;/jaxb:globalBindings&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/jaxb:bindings&amp;gt;
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, add the following options to the execution of your jaxb2-maven-plugin (highlighted):&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;13,14,15&amp;quot;]
&lt;plugin>
&lt;groupId>org.codehaus.mojo&lt;/groupId>
&lt;artifactId>jaxb2-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
&lt;version>1.5&lt;/version>
&lt;executions>
&lt;execution>
&lt;id>somestuff&lt;/id>
&lt;goals>
&lt;goal>xjc&lt;/goal>
&lt;/goals>
&lt;configuration>
&lt;clearOutputDir>false&lt;/clearOutputDir>
&lt;extension>true&lt;/extension>
&lt;bindingDirectory>${basedir}/src/main/resources/jaxb&lt;/bindingDirectory>
&lt;bindingFiles>simple-binding.xjb&lt;/bindingFiles>
&lt;staleFile>${project.build.directory}/jaxb2/.somestuff.StaleFlag&lt;/staleFile>
&lt;packageName>generated.somestuff&lt;/packageName>

&lt;schemaFiles>somestuff.xsd&lt;/schemaFiles>
&lt;/configuration>
&lt;/execution>
&lt;/executions>
&lt;/plugin>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should be able to re-generate the jaxb code now, and parsing should work. In order to test if you have this problem, and to ensure that it does not come back after somebody changes your build file, create a unittest which marshals a java object into xml, and then unmarshalls the generated xml back into an object:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;java&amp;quot;]
// Create document objects (JAXB Generated classes)
Document sourceDocument = new Document();
sourcedocument.setSomeElement(new SomeElement());&lt;/p>
&lt;p>JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Document.class);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>// Write Document
File file = File.createTempFile(&amp;quot;sometempstuff&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.xml&amp;quot;);
FileWriter fileWr = new FileWriter(file);
XMLOutputFactory xml = XMLOutputFactory.newFactory();
XMLStreamWriter xmlStrWr = xml.createXMLStreamWriter(fileWr);
xmlStrWr.writeStartDocument(&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;);
Marshaller marshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();
marshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FRAGMENT, true);
marshaller.marshal(sourceDocument, xmlStrWr);
xmlStrWr.writeEndDocument();
fileWr.close();&lt;/p>
&lt;p>// Read Document
FileInputStream fileInpStr = new FileInputStream(file);
Unmarshaller unm = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();
Document result = (Document) unm.unmarshal(fileInpStr);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>// Test the parsedDocument here if you like.
...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>// Cleanup

&lt;p>The reason for this blog is of course the fact that I expected this &amp;quot;Simple Binding&amp;quot; to be the default, as 80% of the people will want to do exactly this. I've found a lot of people suffering from this problem, and I found the documentation to be not very helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this blog post helps you get on with more important stuff.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>Undoubtedly the Baofeng UV-5Rx delivers a lot of radio for your buck. However some models in the range have a bad reputation for the transmitted audio sounding soft and muffled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2013, Remco PA3FYM obtained the schematics of the radio and &lt;a href="http://remco.org/index.php?s=baofeng">devised a modification&lt;/a> where transistor Q17 of the VOX is re-purposed as preamplifier in the microphone audio circuit. It works wonders for your radio. For people needing a bit more visual guidance, below is a walktrough of how I did this to my Baofeng UV-5RA.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->On the left you find the original schematics of the microphone and vox circuits. On the right, I've marked the modifications we're about to do in red.

&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![uv5r-schema-after](uv5r-schema-after.png)
](uv5r-schema-after.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
**Step 1: Open the radio
**Open up the Baofeng UV-5RA. There is plenty information online on how to do this, check out [the teardown at takapart](https://www.takeitapart.com/guide/9) for instance. You need to open the radio up to the point that you can access the components on the back of the keypad.
&lt;p>Remember: the radio comes apart without force. If you feel something is not giving, look for solder joints or screws you missed. For easy removal of the display, I used solder wick to remove the solder on the backlight connections:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-1-desolder-display.jpg">&lt;img src="step-1-desolder-display.jpg" alt="Step 1-desolder-display">
&lt;/a>Just to be sure I desoldered the antenna connection but you can also unscrew the antenna connector and carefully force it over the aluminum ridge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-1-desolder-antenna.jpg">&lt;img src="step-1-desolder-antenna.jpg?w=450" alt="Step 1-desolder antenna">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Step 2: Locate components
**Locate the components in the schematic on the printed circuit board. Use a multimeter to ensure yourself that you are looking at the right components:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-2-locate-components.jpg">&lt;img src="step-2-locate-components.jpg" alt="Step 2 Locate components">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Step 3: Disconnect Emitter of Q17
Take a (very very) small drillbit and carefully disconnect the emitter of Q17:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-3-disconnect-emitter.jpg">&lt;img src="step-3-disconnect-emitter.jpg?w=450" alt="Step 3 disconnect emitter">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end result should look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-3-result.jpg">&lt;img src="step-3-result.jpg" alt="step 3 result">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Step 4: Add 560 Ohm resistor
**Use a very small soldering iron tip and small tweezers or toothpick put the 560 (or 680) Ohm resistor in place:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-4-resistor-in-place.jpg">&lt;img src="step-4-resistor-in-place.jpg?w=450" alt="Step 4 resistor in place">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, the 560 Ohm resistor gave a bit too much amplification. For a bit more modest result, choose 680 (like Remco did), or anything up to 1k Ohm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 5: Remove C135 and disconnect L44&lt;/strong>
Using the small tip of your soldering iron, heat up and wipe down on C135 to remove it. Take care to not hit other components, repairs will be almost impossible. Use the small drillbit to disconnect L44 by cutting the little trace between C137 and L44:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-5-disconnect-l44.jpg">&lt;img src="step-5-disconnect-l44.jpg" alt="Step 5 disconnect L44">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Step 6: Connect Q17 to L44
**Take a small piece of enamel coated wire, strip 2mm at the ends and connect the collector of Q17 to L44:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-6-connect-l44.jpg">&lt;img src="step-6-connect-l44.jpg?w=450" alt="Step 6 Connect L44">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 7: Close it up&lt;/strong>
Put your radio back together. Don't forget to solder the antenna connector and backlight connections I mentioned in step 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When snapping the PCB back into the case, make sure that the rubber of the PTT button does not fold behind the PCB board. Make sure the rubber is nice and flat after inserting the PCB, like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="step-7-ptt-buttons.jpg">&lt;img src="step-7-ptt-buttons.jpg?w=450" alt="Step 7 PTT buttons">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun with your new and improved modulation!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3tj1kV1hs">&lt;img src="61c1ee2ce9d31c894d188b7b17cacee90ffdece8bc4c4798d10100b7515820de.jpg" alt="Everybody gets a database!">
&lt;/a>When doing integration testing or fixing a bug in a piece of Java code that uses Oracle as a database, being able to do quick exports and imports of your schema can be a big help. Sometimes just calling Oracle's imp/exp commandline tools from your code can be of help, but I was looking for something a bit more portable and less demanding on my local development machine. I found that Oracle's datapump functionality can be called from stored procedures, which in turn can be called from a normal JDBC statement.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Combining Oracle's information and questions like this one on StackOverflow, I've come up with a solution that allows me to call Java methods to import and export a database schema to a dumpfile, like so:
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;java&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
import(&amp;quot;myschema&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;myschema.dmp&amp;quot;);
export(&amp;quot;myschema&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;myschema.dmp&amp;quot;);
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These methods make use of regular JDBC calls, are implemented as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;java&amp;quot;]
public static final String EXPORT_DIR = &amp;quot;/tmp&amp;quot;;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>public void export(String schema, String fileName)
throws SQLException, IOException {
String sql = getFileContents(&amp;quot;export.sql&amp;quot;);
pStmt pStmt = dataSource
.getConnection()
.prepareStatement(sql);
pStmt.setString(1, schema.toUpperCase());
pStmt.setString(2, EXPORT_DIR);
pStmt.setString(3, fileName);
pStmt.execute();
}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>public void import(String schema, String fileName)
throws IOException, SQLException {
String sql = getFileContents(&amp;quot;import.sql&amp;quot;);
pStmt pStmt = dataSource
.getConnection()
.prepareStatement(sql);
pStmt.setString(1, schemaName.toUpperCase());
pStmt.setString(2, EXPORT_DIR);
pStmt.setString(3, fileName);
pStmt.execute();
}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>private String getFileContents(String fileName)
throws IOException {
InputStream in = this.getClass()
.getResourceAsStream(fileName);
return IOUtils.toString(in, &amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;);
}
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see in the code, I create prepared statements from two sql files which are located in the same Java package. The &amp;quot;export.sql&amp;quot; contains the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;sql&amp;quot;]
DECLARE
schemaname VARCHAR2(200) := ?;
directoryname VARCHAR2(200) := ?;
dumpfilename VARCHAR2(200) := ?;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>directoryvariable VARCHAR(100)
:= 'EXPORT_DIR_' || schemaname;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>handle NUMBER;
status VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY '
|| directoryvariable || ' AS '''
|| directoryname || '''';&lt;/p>
&lt;p>handle := DBMS_DATAPUMP.OPEN(
operation =&amp;gt; 'EXPORT',
job_mode =&amp;gt; 'SCHEMA',
job_name =&amp;gt; 'datapump export schema '
|| schemaname);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.ADD_FILE(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
filename =&amp;gt; dumpfilename,
directory =&amp;gt; directoryvariable,
reusefile =&amp;gt; 1);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.ADD_FILE(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
filename =&amp;gt; dumpfilename || '.export.log',
directory =&amp;gt; directoryvariable,
filetype =&amp;gt; DBMS_DATAPUMP.KU$_FILE_TYPE_LOG_FILE,
reusefile =&amp;gt; 1);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.METADATA_FILTER(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
name =&amp;gt; 'SCHEMA_EXPR',
value =&amp;gt; 'IN (''' || schemaname || ''')');&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.START_JOB(handle);
DBMS_DATAPUMP.WAIT_FOR_JOB(handle, status);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DROP DIRECTORY '
|| directoryvariable;
END;
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;quot;import.sql&amp;quot; looks very similar, containing the following code:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;sql&amp;quot;]
DECLARE
schemaname VARCHAR2(200) := ?;
directoryname VARCHAR2(200) := ?;
dumpfilename VARCHAR2(200) := ?;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>directoryvariable VARCHAR(100) := 'EXPORT_DIR_'
|| schemaname;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>handle NUMBER;
status VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY '
|| directoryvariable || ' AS '''
|| directoryname || '''';&lt;/p>
&lt;p>handle := DBMS_DATAPUMP.OPEN(
operation =&amp;gt; 'IMPORT',
job_mode =&amp;gt; 'SCHEMA',
job_name =&amp;gt; 'datapump import schema '
|| schemaname);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.ADD_FILE(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
filename =&amp;gt; dumpfilename,
directory =&amp;gt; directoryvariable);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.ADD_FILE(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
filename =&amp;gt; dumpfilename || '.import.log',
directory =&amp;gt; directoryvariable,
filetype =&amp;gt; DBMS_DATAPUMP.KU$_FILE_TYPE_LOG_FILE,
reusefile =&amp;gt; 1);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.SET_PARAMETER(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
name =&amp;gt; 'table_exists_action',
value =&amp;gt; 'REPLACE');&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.METADATA_FILTER(
handle =&amp;gt; handle,
name =&amp;gt; 'SCHEMA_EXPR',
value =&amp;gt; 'IN (''' || schemaname || ''')');&lt;/p>
&lt;p>DBMS_DATAPUMP.START_JOB(handle);
DBMS_DATAPUMP.WAIT_FOR_JOB(handle, status);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DROP DIRECTORY '
|| directoryvariable;
END;
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recommend reading the Oracle Datapump documentation (albeit dangerously enterprisey) to see what exactly happens when these scripts run. For instance, dumpfiles are reused (overwritten) without notice, and logfiles are created next to the dumpfile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, I write the dumpfiles to the &amp;quot;/tmp&amp;quot; directory on the database server. You can change this to any directory you like, but please make sure that the directory exists, and that the oracle user or orainst group has write access in that directory. A good way to start is first make it work with the /tmp directory, as in this example. If Oracle can not (over)write a file for any reason, you will get incomprehensible error messages about incorrect parameters in the dbms.datapump.add_file() calls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy your Oracle-free development environment!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arduino and the QVGA 2.2" TFT SPI screen</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2014/11/17/arduino-and-the-qvga-2-2-tft-spi-screen/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Nov 2014 10:37:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2014/11/17/arduino-and-the-qvga-2-2-tft-spi-screen/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.elecfreaks.com/store/22%C3%82%E2%80%99-tft-lcd-tft0122sp-p-672.html">&lt;img src="2-2sp_a.jpg" alt="QVGA SPI 2.2" 320x240 screen">
&lt;/a>I went throughÂ all the struggles everybody else seems to be going through to get this screen connected to my &lt;a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardNano">Arduino Nano&lt;/a>. I had the 5V to 3.3V voltage conversion problem, and the &amp;quot;only works with software interrupts&amp;quot; problem which makes the display run slow. The solutions are not complicated but not very wel documented. Until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: It's a 3.3V screen&lt;/strong>
Before connecting the screen to your Arduino, it's important to know that this screen uses 3.3V logic. That means that connecting your Arduino to it will likely ruin the screen. If you're not using the CF cardreader on the screen then the communication is one-way to the screen. Converting your 5V outputs to 3.3V is really simple, all you need is a couple of cheap 1N4148 diodes and a few resistors (for alternatives, see below). Connect your screen as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="foto-2.jpg">&lt;img src="foto-2.jpg" alt="Simple Level Conversion">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please make sure you wire &lt;em>all&lt;/em> connections in this schematic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: Hidden pins in the code&lt;/strong>
The &lt;a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_ILI9340">Adafruit ILI9340 library&lt;/a> contains some examples on how to get the screen running. You'll need the SPI and Adafruit_GFX libraries too, as shown in the header of the examples. Let's look at a little code that alternates the screen between black and white:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;cpp&amp;quot;]
/*&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Example code to make the TFT alternate&lt;/li>
&lt;li>between black and white using hardware SPI:
*/
#include &amp;quot;SPI.h&amp;quot;
#include &amp;quot;Adafruit_GFX.h&amp;quot;
#include &amp;quot;Adafruit_ILI9340.h&amp;quot;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>// TFT pin mappings for UNO/NANO
#define _sclk 13
#define _miso 12
#define _mosi 11
#define _cs 10
#define _dc 9
#define _rst 8&lt;/p>
&lt;p>// Use hardware SPI
Adafruit_ILI9340 tft = Adafruit_ILI9340(_cs, _dc, _rst);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>void setup() {
tft.begin();
tft.fillScreen(ILI9340_GREEN);
}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>void loop() {
tft.fillScreen(ILI9340_BLACK);
tft.fillScreen(ILI9340_WHITE);
}
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that there is something funny going on here. The constructor for the Adafruit_ILI9340 object only has _cs, _dc, and _rst as parameter. Initially I thought &amp;quot;Great, only 3 connections to the display!&amp;quot;. Alas, this is not the case.Â &lt;em>&lt;strong>You still need to wire the _sclk and _mosi port to the display&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>. The _miso port can be left out, but you can't use it for anything else on the Arduino side because the library seems to be accessing it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have your connections correct and upload the example above to your Arduino, you should see your screen continuously alternate between black and white. You will be able to see the drawing of the screen, but it should not take more than 1 second to fill the whole screen. If it takes more than a second to fill the screen, you're likely using the software SPI method. Check the code and the connections again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is how the data on the _mosi pin looks on a &lt;a href="http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/tektronix_storage_oscilloscope_7623a.html">Tektronix 7623A oscilloscope&lt;/a> when drawing graphics on the TFT screen. It's not a perfect square because of the capacitance of the diodes, but the difference between high and low states is good enough and the slope is just fast enough so that the display sees all the bits that are sent to it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="foto.jpg">&lt;img src="foto.jpg" alt="MOSI data">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Alternative 5V to 3.3V conversions:&lt;/strong>
&lt;img src="foto-1.jpg" alt="Zener conversion">
If you don't have enough diodes, you can use zener diodes as shown on the right. I have not tested this on my screen but it should give you similar results, and saves you a few components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A much nicer, two-way level conversion enables you to connect the _miso port to talk to the CF Card Reader. You can make this
with an N-Channel MOSFET. Check Andrew's blog on &lt;a href="http://www.rocketnumbernine.com/2009/04/10/5v-33v-bidirectional-level-converter">how to use an N-channel FET to do the conversion&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>It's not until you or someone very close to you becomes dependant on a wheelchair until you notice that the world is not as wheelchair friendly as you might think. Hotel rooms are wheelchair accessable, but the lobby can only be reached by stairs. People with kids can take strollers all the way up to the airplane seat, but people in wheelchairs need to magically heal themselves and leave the wheelchair at the gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But this is not a rant about inconsiderate travel company employees. This is about helping people with &amp;quot;a challenge&amp;quot;, as our funny American neighbours tend to call it. And no, this is also not a rant about helping in a big way, raising a million for a cause, getting all the local supermarkets to give away groceries to people in wheelchairs, or TV shows selling tear-jerking advertisement minutes while building a house for a familiy who really needs it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, this is about the little things. Things that make you and me different. Things that require only a little twitch of a muscle for healthy people. Quirky things like aligning the napkin to the edge of the table, or petting a cat, or getting a different color straw because it doesn't match the color of your shirt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine you had to ask somebody to align your napkin to the edge of the table. That person would find you demanding, and because he doesn't see what's solved by doing that, it's very likely that the napkin will never move. Soon, you will stop asking people to do the little things that used to make you who you were.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's a tough choice. Loose friends because they think you're too much of a demanding prinsess, or loose friends because you stop being you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you see or know somebody in a wheelchair, remember that their mind still wants to do those quirky things that make them who they are. It's okay to say no, but please consider this little blogpost when somebody asks you to straighten their bracelet or clean their glasses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The world does not need one-time big-mouthed Facebook-selfie heroes. The world needs polite people who can discretely hand over a napkin without asking what's it for.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Print posters on a regular printer with Excel.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2014/05/15/print-posters-on-a-regular-printer-with-excel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 May 2014 20:24:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2014/05/15/print-posters-on-a-regular-printer-with-excel/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently needed to print out a big schematic diagram of the RX/TX board of a Kenwood TS50 Transceiver. This did not fit on a single piece of paper. Instead of downloading all kinds of crappy tools or uploading the image to some &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; site which is going to use it for whatever they think justifies their definition of &amp;quot;free&amp;quot;, I found out you can do this in Excel. Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Make sure the image you want to print out as a poster has a decent resolution
2. Open Excel (maybe this will work in LibreOffice too, I haven't tested, let me know)
3. Drag the image into a new worksheet so that it is top-left of the sheet.
4. Open the &amp;quot;Print preview&amp;quot; (the little icon in the bottom left of the window)
5. Resize the image so that it covers more than one page, up to the number of pages you'd like the poster to be. Your screen should now look somewhat like this:
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="screen-shot-2014-05-15-at-21-58-23.png">&lt;img src="screen-shot-2014-05-15-at-21-58-23.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-05-15 at 21.58.23">
&lt;/a>
6. Optional: Adjust the page margins.
7. Print.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=at6HrV5CTo8">&lt;img src="security.png" alt="Firewall">
&lt;/a>The new firewall in Mavericks is great. For the common user. For a developer, not so much. If you are a Java developer like me, and you just need to open one port (say, 8080) so that the web application youâre working on is accessable from another computer, you canât. I disabled the Firewall altogether for a few days, but it didn't feel right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I googled around and to make a long story short, hereâs how to open port 8080 on any interface to any application on your OSX Mavericks installation in 3 steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sudo vim /etc/pf.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then add the following lines at the end of the file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code># Open port 8080 for TCP on all interfaces pass in proto tcp from any to any port 8080&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Test (and, according to the documentation, load) your edits with:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>sudo pfctl -vnf /etc/pf.conf&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reboot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I have found at least 5 pieces of voodoo to make the Firewall restart and reload, but none of them seemed to work reliably, so pardon the reboot)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can close it by commenting out the lines in pf.conf and reboot again. If anybody knows of an easier way to do this, preferably in one terminal command, and without rebooting, let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope this helps.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>There's life without Google. Or iCloud.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://threema.ch/en/">&lt;img src="appicon128.png" alt="Threema, the secure Whatsapp alternative">
&lt;/a>Regular readers of this blog already know that I amÂ &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/1355/">not using dropbox&lt;/a>, and I was an Evernote user, but recently decided it became to dangerous and &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/?s=evernote">replaced it with my own scripts&lt;/a>. I had an interesting discussion on Twitter which made me decide to show you how I run my digital life without the help of Google, Facebook, Dropbox, Whatsapp or iCloud, and still be able to have all the functionality these services offer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The search was hard and sometimes I need to reconsider some of the choices, but the last few years the selection of products was very stable and the setup has worked flawlessly. Searching for a secure replacement for Whatsapp or Google? It's in here.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
Original
The Safer Alternative:
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Whatsapp
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[**Threema**](https://threema.ch/en/). Hands-down the best safe messaging service. Easy to use, group chats, image and video transfers. Under the hood it always uses true end-to-end encryption, and does not store any data about you or contacts your addressbook while still being able to find your friends. Threema costs a mere â¬1,70 for the iPhone and â¬1,60 for Android, and is very clear about their revenue model. Sending a message is free of charge. No I don't use Telegram.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Mail
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**[Hushmail](https://www.hushmail.com/services/hushmail/)**. A Canadian email provider which at least claims it respects your privacy and is not bound to American legislation. I use their [Premium service](https://www.hushmail.com/premium/) which costs $35 a year. A bargain.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Google Search
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)**. Although there are some sceptics out there who argue that there is no way to verify how duckduckgo is any different than Google's search engine, I still think it is a better alternative. One of the most important ones is that they don't ["bubble"](http://dontbubble.us) you. Image searching is not possible yet. so I do fall back to Google for that every now and than, but only in a separate, private browser session with cleared cookies.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Google Maps
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >The Apple [**Maps**](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/06/26/new-maps-app-in-os-x-mavericks-extends-tools-for-reporting-fixing-errors) app, or if you don't have a Mac or need to search online:Â [Mapquest](http://www.mapquest.com) provides a good alternative to Google maps. Not the prettiest interface, but any product other than a Google product gives them less data to harvest on me. Always remember: If you're not paying for the product, you're the product.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Calendar, Contacts
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[**Owncloud**](http://owncloud.org). In my case, I have bought a $40 Raspberry Pi which is beautifully running Owncloud to sync Calendars over SSL between my iPhone and all my Macs. It requires a bit of Linux skills and isn't really safe "out of the box", but can be made pretty airtight. **Remember to close all ports and only access Owncloud over**** SSL** (most tutorials wrongly teach you otherwise), and don't expect high performance from the Raspberry when it comes to rendering browser pages.Â I've added a little script that sends backups to my file server via SMB.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >File synching (Dropbox)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[**SpiderOak**](https://spideroak.com/signup/referral/4b01a22f64d398afbd846637080bd2b4/). A true zero-knowledge encrypted file storage. With the new ["Hive" feature](https://spideroak.com/hive/) it behaves exactly like Dropbox, but has additional features like a backup service. Choose a safe password and store it somewhere secure, because Spideroak can not recover your password or your files if you loose it. I started with the 2GB free for life account, but it soon grew to a 50GB account. Great stuff, very reliable, safe.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Evernote
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**[SpiderNote](http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2014/03/02/replace-evernote-with-spidernote/)**. It may be a bit cobbled together, but as an old Evernote fan I needed a good alternative and it should be able to sync between all my Macs. So I save my notes in a SpiderOak folder and search them with Spotlight. Not as fancy as Evernote, but the price (risk) of storing my data unencrypted on an American server became too high.Â **
**
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Facebook
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[**Twitter**](https://twitter.com/rolfje#). I hate to dissapoint you, but Facebook is free of charge and they store your entire digital life. What do you think is Facebook's product precisely? Also, I see that you have 86.355 "friends" on Facebook. I hate to disappoint you but those are called "random strangers". Even if your account is *cough* private (except for Mark $uckeberg). I like to talk to people too, that's why I have this blog, and for the smaller chit-chat I use Twitter. My real friends are on Threema, or, if need be, I talk to them. It's very old-fashioned. I drive over and meet them in person. And sometimes they even come to my house. I know, crazy right? Old school.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >LinkedIn
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >None. I could hold the same rant for Facebook and LinkedIn alike. They're not there for you. You're there for them. I did make the mistake of creating a LinkedIn account a long time ago because people said "you need this". After quite a few mails from LinkedIn requesting me to endorse people, update my profile or water their plants, I realized that I was working for them, not the other way around. I cancelled and deleted my account. Guess what? I'm still alive and well.Â If you're a developer, you're better off by gaining community based reputation on sites like **[Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/21134/rolf)**.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr valign="top" >
&lt;td >Local Backups
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**[Encrypted TimeMachine](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH11102)** and Time Capsule volumes. My local drives are also full-disk encrypted using Apple's built-in [FileVault 2](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4790?viewlocale=en_US&amp;locale=en_US). There is a Mac Mini file server in the house which holds all familiy photos Â so that we can view them on the TV for example. The photos are on a read-only fileshare and are backed up using Time Machine locally.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Remote/Offsite Backups
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[**Crashplan Free**](https://www.code42.com/store/), sending the data on the TimeMachine drive on the fileserver to another fileserver at my parents' house. His fileserver backs up on my machine and vice-versa. One house can completely burn down and we still have all data, without it ever being uploaded to some unencrypted company server.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
**Why not Telegram?**
A few words of advice on using Telegram: Whatever they tell you, the data is *not* (properly) encrypted and it is easy to tell: The data is [stored in their "cloud"](http://unhandledexpression.com/2013/12/17/telegram-stand-back-we-know-maths/) and provided to you on all your devices. Even worse: They are [showing your data to "potential friends"](http://mcleaver.blogspot.nl/2014/02/telegram-verses-whatsapp.html?m=1) who [do not have you in their contact](https://twitter.com/GVerbaan/status/436909531625697280) lists or may have never heard of you. They upload your complete address book to their servers. They also know the [geolocation of your phone](http://blog.hackapp.com/2013/12/telegram-secret-chat-geolocation-leak.html). Unencrypted. They have your data, and show it by leaking it. They can fix the leaks and tell you it's safe, but they still have your data. It's also fishy that they clearly [have money to pimp their server farm](https://twitter.com/telegram/status/437745646007631872), even when the app and the messages are free of charge. Who do you think is the product here?

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/28/AR2010072806141.html">&lt;img src="evernotensa.png" alt="Resistance is futile">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the past I have used Evernote extensively, it really helped me in my research for this blog and keeping track of meeting notes, todo lists and even making pictures of whiteboards at work searchable. As a product, there is no note taking app that can beat Evernote. But there is a little problem that has become a deal breaker for me, and that is basically the NSA and the way Americans, and particularly the American government seems to think about people's privacy and online security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Evernote is an American company, which sadly has to comply with whatever ridiculous request by the U.S. government to turn over data of innocent people all over the world (yes, even outside the U.S. border, I know, itâs amazing). This, combined with the fact that Evernote clearly can not use zero-knowledge encryption because of the services it provides, makes that all the data you and I put into Evernote are at NSAâs fingertips at all times. If you find that as scary as I do, and you have a Mac, there is a way to solve this.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use Evernote to sync notes between multiple Macs, you have to solve the syncing problem first. Ofcourse Dropbox is a no-go, because that is an American company storing unencrypted data too. Iâm &lt;a href="https://rolfje.wordpress.com/2011/07/03/1355/">using SpiderOakÂ  since 2011&lt;/a>, and it is much better than Dropbox in many ways. Check it out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If youâre using Evernote on your iPhone I do not have a solution for you yet. But as for me, that is not a big deal, I thought the iPhone is not the ideal note taking platform anyway as this old man is not very fast on the touch keyboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="spidy_5407spx_02.jpg">&lt;img src="spidy_5407spx_02.jpg" alt="Spidernote Icon">
&lt;/a>With all that out of the way, letâs migrate away from Evernote and replace it with a smart script and some synced Spideroak folders. I like to call it âSpiderNoteâ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Create a folder structure&lt;/strong>
Inside your Spideroak shared folder or Hive, create a âSpidernoteâ folder, and in that folder, create a ânotesâ folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2: Export all Evernote Notes&lt;/strong>
Start up your trusty Evernote client and select all your notes. From the âFileâ menu, select âExport Notesâ¦â and store them in a folder called âEvernoteâ, inside the ânotesâ folder you just created. You should now have a folder called Spidernote/notes/Evernote somewhere inside your Spideroak folder, or somewhere locally on your Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3: Getting Spotlight and Finder to work for you&lt;/strong>
Open the Finder and press Cmd-, or select âPreferencesâ¦â On the âAdvancedâ tab, under âWhen performing a Searchâ select âSearch the current Folderâ. After you do this, you will find that when you open the notes folder in Finder, you can type some text and your old Evernote notes will popup. Look ma, no hands! And no Evernote!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="finder-search-settings.png">&lt;img src="finder-search-settings.png?w=450" alt="Finder Search Settings">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4: Create a new template note&lt;/strong>
OSX comes with a decent richtext editor, named âTextEditâ which we are going to use for our note taking.Open TextEdit and save an empty file inside the notes folder which is called âempty.rtfâ. This will be your note template, the start of every new note. Remember you can set preferences that are stored with this file, like the default font and colors and tabs if you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5: Script to create a new note&lt;/strong>
Create a file called ânewnote.commandâ in the Spidernote folder and copy/paste the following contents into it:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;bash&amp;quot;]
#!/bin/bash
date=&lt;code>date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S&lt;/code>
BASEDIR=$(dirname $0)
cd $BASEDIR&lt;/p>
&lt;p>notesdirectory=&amp;quot;notes/${date}&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>clear
echo &amp;quot;Note will be stored in ${BASEDIR}/${notesdirectory}.&amp;quot;
echo &amp;quot;Type title/filename for note (without extension):&amp;quot;
read filename&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if [[ X&amp;quot;&amp;quot; = X&amp;quot;$filename&amp;quot; ]]; then
filename=&amp;quot;note.rtf&amp;quot;;
fi&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mkdir &amp;quot;${notesdirectory}&amp;quot;
cp notes/empty.rtf &amp;quot;${notesdirectory}/${filename}.rtf&amp;quot;
rm -f lastnote.rtf
ln -s &amp;quot;${notesdirectory}/${filename}.rtf&amp;quot; latestnote.rtf
open -a TextEdit &amp;quot;${notesdirectory}/${filename}.rtf&amp;quot;
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should now have a folder structure which looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="folder-structure-1.png">&lt;img src="folder-structure-1.png" alt="Spidernote Folder Structure">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6: Add Spidernote to your Dock&lt;/strong>
Drag the Spidernote folder next to your Trashcan in the doc (not IN your Trashcan, of course). Change the settings to have itâs icon show as a folder, and itâs context as a list. All set!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7: Create your first note&lt;/strong>
From the Dock, click on the Spidernote folder and click on ânewnote.commandâ. A Terminal window will pop up, asking you for the (optional) title of your note (this will be the filename of the *.rtf file, so that it is easier to scan your search results later). After you press âenterâ, TextEdit will come up and you can type away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are done and close the editor, you can easily find your note by searching, or by the âlatest noteâ link which the script creates for you in the Spidernote folder, so that you always can return to what you were doing when you accidentally close that note.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thatâs it for now. I know it does not OCR scan your images, and it is really a poor-manâs Evernote, but these days your private has become a valuable asset to scrupules people and it has to be protected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know that there are a lot of note taking apps out there but frankly none of them work for me. If you have any tips on how to solve the OCR and tagging/organizing stuff please let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and don't forget to &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/article/23403793">deactivate your Evernote account and remove all its data&lt;/a>. After all, that's what started all this sad stuff.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From the Finder to the Shell (and back)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/12/20/from-the-finder-to-the-shell-and-back/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:10:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/12/20/from-the-finder-to-the-shell-and-back/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A quick tip for OSX users out there who frequently need to open a Terminal window for the current location in the finder, or the other way around:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="open-folder.png" alt="Go2Shell and Back">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install the free application from the App Store: &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/go2shell/id445770608?l=en&amp;amp;mt=12">Go2Shell&lt;/a>. It will give you an icon on the toolbar of your Finder, and pressing it will open a Terminal window and automatically change it's directory to match the Finder's location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other way around is easier; you can already do that on any Mac. Simply type &amp;quot;open .&amp;quot; (that's the word &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;, followed by a space and a period). This command will open a Finder window for the directory location your Terminal window is in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus tip:&lt;/strong> Also check the &amp;quot;open -t [filename]&amp;quot; command, it will open your system's default text editor with the given file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anonimatron: Quick Start</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/11/03/anonimatron-quick-start/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Nov 2013 14:33:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/11/03/anonimatron-quick-start/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opk4x7jzRS4">&lt;img src="homer.png" alt="Anonymous customer">
&lt;/a>After reading my last blogpost on Anonimatron, you must have asked yourself &amp;quot;Great, but how do I actually use Anonimatron to de-personalize my database&amp;quot;? I tried my best to make basic Anonimatron configuration as self-explanatory as possible, just start it without any command line arguments and it will tell you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Less adventurous or in a big hurry? This blogpost will show how simple it is to install and configure Anonimatron on an example MySQL database.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Setting up a test database**
&lt;p>To demonstrate what Anonimatron can do to your data, we will create a little test database to play with. Anonimatron connects to all kinds of databases, including MySQL, Postgress and Oracle. In this example, we use MySQL. Here are all the statements you need to create a little database with 2 tables, a user, and some &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; data:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code lang=&amp;quot;sql&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
create database mydb;
create user myuser identified by 'mypassword';
grant all privileges on &lt;em>.&lt;/em> to 'myuser'@'localhost'
identified by 'mypassword' with grant option;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>create table mydb.userdata (
id int not null auto_increment primary key,
firstname varchar(20),
lastname varchar(20),
creditcardnr varchar(20)
);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>create table mydb.lastnames (
id int not null auto_increment primary key,
lastname varchar(20)
);&lt;/p>
&lt;p>insert into mydb.userdata
(firstname,lastname, creditcardnr)
values ('Homer', 'Simpson','1234'),
('Marge', 'Simpson','5678'),
('Ned', 'Flanders','3456'),
('Charles', 'Burns','3456');&lt;/p>
&lt;p>insert into mydb.lastnames (lastname)
values ('Simpson'), ('Flanders'), ('Burns');
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After all the hard work, you should be able to connect to the database with 'myuser' and see the &amp;quot;private&amp;quot; data in there:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code language=&amp;quot;sql&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
select * from mydb.userdata;
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
id
firstname
lastname
creditcardnr
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Homer
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Simpson
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1234
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Marge
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Simpson
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >5678
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >3
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ned
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Flanders
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >3456
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >4
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Charles
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Burns
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >3456
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
[code language="sql" light="true"]
select * from mydb.lastnames;
[/code]
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
id
lastname
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Simpson
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Flanders
&lt;/td>

Let's pretend that this is a copy of a production database, and you want to de-personalize or anonymize it.
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Installing Anonimatron&lt;/strong>
To anonymize your data,Â  &lt;a href="http://http://anonimatron.sourceforge.net">download Anonimatron&lt;/a> and unzip it in a directory of your choice. You should find an &amp;quot;anonimatron.sh&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;anonimatron.bat&amp;quot; file there. Depending on your system, run it without arguments. If you have java installed on your system you should see something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
$ ./anonimatron.sh&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is Anonimatron 1.7, a command line tool to consistently
replace live data in your database with data data which
can not be traced back to the original data.
You can use this tool to transform a dump from a production
database into a large representative dataset you can
share with your development and test team.
Use the -configexample command line option to get an idea of
what your configuration file needs to look like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>usage: java -jar anonimatron.jar
-config The XML Configuration file describing what to
anonymize.
-configexample Prints out a demo/template configuration file.
-dryrun Do not make changes to the database.
-synonyms The XML file to read/write synonyms to. If the file
does not exist it will be created.
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Victory! You've installed Anonimatron. Yes, life can really be that easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Configuring Anonimatron&lt;/strong>
Next, we need to tell Anonimatron how to connect to our database, and which tables and columns to process and how. The hardest part of this is probably figuring out how to create a jdbc connect string. Anonimatron can help you with that. If you start anonimatron with the &amp;quot;-configexample&amp;quot; parameter, it will scan the jdbcdrivers directory for available and supported drivers, and will show you how a jdbc URL for any of these should look:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
$ ./anonimatron.sh -configexample&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Supported Database URL formats:
Jdbc URL format By Driver
jdbc:oracle:oci8:@[SID] oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST]:[PORT]:[SID] oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
jdbc:oracle:oci:@[SID] oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
jdbc:postgresql://[HOST]:[PORT]/[DB] org.postgresql.Driver
jdbc:mysql://[HOST]:[PORT]/[DB] org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anonimatron will try to autodetect drivers which are
stored in the lib directory. Add you driver there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>...
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, we have just created a MySQL database, so we'll use that URL and fill in the blanks. We use the rest of the configuration example and with some copy-pasting we come up with the following configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;p>&lt;configuration jdbcurl="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb"
userid="mydata" password="mypassword">&lt;/p>
&lt;table name="userdata">
&lt;column name="firstname" type="ROMAN_NAME" />
&lt;column name="lastname" type="ELVEN_NAME" />
&lt;column name="creditcardnr" type="RANDOMDIGITS"/>
&lt;/table>
&lt;table name="lastnames">
&lt;column name="lastname" type="ELVEN_NAME" />
&lt;/table>
&lt;/configuration>
[/code]
&lt;p>This simple configuration file will tell Anonimatron the following things:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * How to connect to the mydb database
* The values in username.firstname should be processed with the ROMAN_NAME Anonymizer. Anonymizers are little plugins which are able to generate data with certain properties, sometimes based on the original data. This particular Anonymizer generates Roman Names by picking syllables from a builtin list.
* The values in username.lastname should be replaced by Elven names. This is almost identical to Roman names but with a different Syllable file.
* The userdata.creditcardnr should be replaced by a set of random digits of the same length. In our case, 4 digits will be replaced by 4 differnt digits. Should you really need numbers which are semantically correct credit card numbers, you could write your own Anonymizer plugin. We'll cover that in a later blogpost.
* The lastnames.lastname column is also an Elven name. Because of the way Anonimatron handles data, strings in this column will be processed exactly the same way as the userdata.lastname column, as we will see below.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Anonymize!&lt;/strong>
Now that we have configured Anonimatron, it's time to start it up and tell it to use our configuration file and store synonyms. It will be finished in the blink of an eye, and your output should look somewhat like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
$ ./anonimatron.sh -config config.xml -synonyms synonyms.xml&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anonymization process started&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jdbc url : jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
Database user : mydata
To do : 2 tables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anonymizing table 'lastnames', total progress [100%, ETA 11:36:56 PM]
Anonymization process completed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing Synonyms to synonyms.xml ...[done].
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If Anonimatron complains or does not run, you might want to check out the &lt;em>anonimatron.log&lt;/em> file for clues. Most log entries will be pretty self-explanatory. If not, please register an issue and we'll see what we can do to fix that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's check the results. First, we can check what synonyms were generated by looking into the synonyms.xml file we told it to create:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
$ cat synonyms.xml
[/code]
[code language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
&lt;synonyms>
&lt;string type="ELVEN_NAME" from="QnVybnM=" to="RGhvZWxsaWFu"/>
&lt;string type="ELVEN_NAME" from="RmxhbmRlcnM=" to="QWhlbGhhbGRldGhlc3M="/>
&lt;string type="ELVEN_NAME" from="U2ltcHNvbg==" to="QWhkdWxlbGhhbGVs"/>
&lt;string type="ROMAN_NAME" from="SG9tZXI=" to="QmVudWxhdWJlbGl1cw=="/>
&lt;string type="ROMAN_NAME" from="TmVk" to="RWN1cw=="/>
&lt;string type="ROMAN_NAME" from="TWFyZ2U=" to="QWxudWxhdWN1cw=="/>
&lt;string type="ROMAN_NAME" from="Q2hhcmxlcw==" to="QWxudXM="/>
&lt;string type="RANDOMDIGITS" from="NTY3OA==" to="ODY5OA=="/>
&lt;string type="RANDOMDIGITS" from="MTIzNA==" to="NDM0Mw=="/>
&lt;string type="RANDOMDIGITS" from="MzQ1Ng==" to="NjEyNQ=="/>
&lt;/synonyms>
[/code]
&lt;p>You'll note that the &amp;quot;from&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to&amp;quot; values look a bit garbled. This is because Anonimatron used Base64 encoding to store values of synonyms. This is so that we can store the values bit for bit, without worying about encodings. If you wanted to, you could easily decode these strings by writing a little program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even without decoding we can see some interesting things about this file. Remember we had lastnames configured as Elven names? Although we have 4 entries in the username table, we see only 3 Elven names. That is because Homer and Marge have the same lastname. These same synonyms are also used by the lastnames.lastname column. The same goes for the creditcard numbers. As might have noticed that Ned Flanders and Charles Burns used the same credit card number in this system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enough staring at XML. Let's get to what matters most: our database. First, let's see if the names and numbers have changed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[code language=&amp;quot;sql&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
select * from mydb.userdata;
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
id
firstname
lastname
creditcardnr
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Benulaubelius
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ahdulelhalel
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >4343
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Alnulaucus
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ahdulelhalel
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >8698
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >3
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ecus
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ahelhaldethess
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >6125
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >4
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Alnus
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Dhoellian
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >6125
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
That looks much better. The first and lastnames are (almost) pronounceable names which probably would look realistic in a screenshot or testcase, yet there is no trace left of the original data that was there. When we check the lastnames table we see that lastnames are being translated consistently with the userdata table:
&lt;p>[code language=&amp;quot;sql&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
select * from mydb.lastnames;
[/code]&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
id
lastname
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ahdulelhalel
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Ahelhaldethess
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >3
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Dhoellian
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
This consistent behavior makes sure that queries where the userdata table and the lastnames table are joined based on lastname will still work.
&lt;p>If you want to play some more with Anonimatron, recreate the original tables, add additional (overlapping) data and re-run anonimatron against it with the synonym file you just created. You'll notice that any &amp;quot;Simpson&amp;quot; lastname will be translated to &amp;quot;Ahdulelhalel&amp;quot; constently on each run. If you don't want that to happen, simply throw away the synonym file or don't tell Anonimatron to use it. You can also generate the synonym file first without doing anything to the database by using the -dryrun option, and later do the same run based on the synonyms generated earlier.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember: The private data &amp;quot;moved&amp;quot; from the database into the synonyms.xml file we created. So that becomes the new data to watch. Store it in a safe place where nobody can access it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun experimenting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anonimatron: Overview</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/10/31/anonimatron-overview/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2013 20:42:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/10/31/anonimatron-overview/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://anonimatron.sf.net/">&lt;img src="itsthelaw.png" alt="It's the Law">
&lt;/a>In every software project, there comes a time where a bug pops up, nobody knows how to reproduce it, and somebody says &amp;quot;I know, let's test this against a copy of the production database&amp;quot;. Even with the best intentions, once production data leaves the production machine with all its safeguards it becomes really hard to do access control on that data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most of the time, it's not even needed to have that data. Developers just need a data set which resembles the production scenario close enough. Some brave souls have mixed succes with data generators, but those generators usually are tedious to maintain and die a slow death under the pressure of the daily grind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In some ambitious projects automated integration testcases are built on top of the data which was inserted by the data generators. As the generators die, so die the tests. If you recognize this pattern, &lt;a href="http://http://anonimatron.sourceforge.net">Anonimatron&lt;/a> might be the answer for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;img src="1-dataindb.png" alt="Customer data in the database.">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let's say you're working on release 5 of a big webshop, and because of the succes of the shop, it runs into performance problems. There's no time or budget to build a data generator, and before you can say no, you have a copy of the production data on some development server, containing the creditcard data of your customers. What do you do?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where Anonimatron comes in. Anonimatron can de-personalize or anonymize your data for you, give you total control over what gets anonymized, and how, and thinks of data types as &amp;quot;color&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;address&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;int&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;String&amp;quot;. Here's how that works:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="2-anonimatron.png" alt="Anonimatron data flow">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For every distinct, unique value A, Anonimatron creates a replacement value X, and writes that back to the database. It stores the A=X relation in a Synonym, and consistently applies those Synonyms throughout all tables in the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By using synonyms, Anonimatron makes sure that your database is still statistically roughly the same as before anonymization, and also makes sure that if you have two tables with a &amp;quot;lastname&amp;quot; column, matching records will actually still match.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anonimatron (optionally) stores these synonyms for later use, so it can be consistent between different runs. New production data? No problem. Load it, tell Anonimatron to use the old synonyms, and the old data will be Anonymized exactly the same as the last time. Only new records will generate new synonyms, which of course will be added to the synonym file for the next run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This feature also enables you to write testscripts based on anonymized production data. Your scripts will not easily break, because new production copies are anonymized very consistently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="3-datainsynonims.png" alt="Data in Synonyms">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the anonymization process, the private data will be in the synonym file. This file needs to be put in a (very) safe place, and only the people that import production data and run Anonimatron should be able to access this file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After anonymization, developers can access the database without immediately being exposed to private addresses of customers, bank accounts, or whatnot. Of course this all depends on what you tell Anonimatron to do, and what to anonymize.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Try to stay away from customer data as much as you can, and handle it with deep respect when you get it, delete it or depersonalize it as soon as you can. Use &lt;a href="http://http://anonimatron.sourceforge.net">Anonimatron&lt;/a> wisely.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS4xIrTYDWU">&lt;img src="ios-7-logo.png" alt="ios-7-logo">
&lt;/a>If you've just installed iOS7 and like it as much as I do, you are probably interested in all the new features of it, and where to find them. On behalf of Apple, I'll be happy to point out where all those neat new features are, and share my happiness about this wonderful new magical market-leading mobile OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Easy-Steal (tm)**
&lt;p>**&lt;a href="easy-steal-e284a2.png">&lt;img src="easy-steal-e284a2.png?w=113" alt="Easy-Steal (â¢)">
&lt;/a>**Remember how in iOS6, you can not just steal an iphone because of the &amp;quot;find my iPhone&amp;quot; feature? Thieves had to put your iPhone in a metal container so it could not tell the owner where it is. Because thieves are people too, we now introduced &amp;quot;Easy-Steal (tm)&amp;quot;. When a thief wants to steal your phone, all he has to do is swipe up, press the little airplane button, and nobody will hear from your iPhone again. Want to disable that? Easy. Hand over your flashlight, calculator, timer, and iPod controls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Separate is the new Integrate&lt;/strong>
Remember how we beautifully integrated FaceTime with the Phone app? How Podcasts could be played from within iTunes? Well we think that's not the future. So we created a separate FaceTime app, and a separate Podcasts app. So you can have more icons on more screens, making it harder to find stuff. We'll let you in on a little secret. Our next big thing? A Separate device for each function. It will be great! You can just take the device you need and leave all the other ones charging on your desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New sounds. And Old Classic ones.&lt;/strong>
Remember how software developers always say you should not use terms as &amp;quot;Old&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; in your software because putting a &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; sticker on a banana will not prevent it from going stale? Well we're not so sure about that. So now, in the old (sorry, new) sound settings, you will find all the same behavior of the old settings, but with new sounds. We've even changed all the sounds your phone makes right from the upgrade. If you would like to revert to the old sounds, don't bother searching in the sounds list. Scroll through the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; list. You know, because on the first screen, there is a list of sounds, and in the second list, there will be... err... a list of sounds. But old. Get it? Did we say it was completely new? We lied. Sorry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Camouflage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="icon-rainbow.png">&lt;img src="icon-rainbow.png" alt="icon rainbow">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All icons are now devoid of those pesky shading and lining that made them visible on all backgrounds. So now, no matter what background color you use, there will always be at least one icon which will blend into the background. We even removed the shading on the text, so you can make that disappear with a simple white background. And did you notice the gradients? Some are light-to-dark, and some are dark-to-light. Why? Because at the new Apple, we hate consistency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Square.&lt;/strong>
A new picture mode. Because you want to make photos. videos, and... err... squares?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Look-at-Me (tm)&lt;/strong>
To make the phone look faster, we made the icons zoom and pan to show how the operating systems moves to help you complete your tasks. It was tested on 500 Dwarf Hamsters and we are pretty sure we made a good job of making people look at your screen while you're using your phone. At least half of those people will get &lt;a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/44165/how-do-i-prevent-motion-sickness-when-using-ios-7/">motion sickness within 15 seconds&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New Applications&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="new-apps.png">&lt;img src="new-apps.png" alt="New Apps">
&lt;/a>
The seasoned iOS6 user will have immediately spotted it: We've got new Applications! Get more accurate timing in your iPhone with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon">Tourbillon&lt;/a> app. Make your own weather predictions with the Barometer app, and create stunning graphics with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot&lt;/a> app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New Puzzles&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_&lt;a href="clickable-puzzle.png">&lt;img src="clickable-puzzle.png?w=450" alt="Clickable Puzzle">
&lt;/a>_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now have hours of fun trying to figure out what is tappable or slidable. Is it the text? Is it the color? Is it the icons? Who knows? We've put great care in removing all visual clues, so start taping and sliding!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The update process has also become more fun. Because we love our non-US iPhone users, we've made the &amp;quot;Purchased&amp;quot; icon a letter &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;. Level up! The dark arrow pointing down ads to the fun when you tap it and... it slides to the left, which reveals your purchases to the right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="updates-puzzle.png">&lt;img src="updates-puzzle.png" alt="Updates Puzzle">
&lt;/a>And did we say one update? We'll list all the past updates too, so you can have more useless info on the screen. For good measure, we even added fun blue dots next to the updated apps you did not open already. How useful is that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="installing.png">&lt;img src="installing.png" alt="Installing..">
&lt;/a>Progress indicators are now even more fun. During updates, your app is named &amp;quot;Installing...&amp;quot; Can you guess what this icon is? If you guessed the application was updating, can you tell if it is at 25% or 75%?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the real advanced puzzlers, we've hidden some controls. Can you make the &amp;quot;Today&amp;quot; widget just display your calendar item without-arbitrary-text-around-it-which-makes-your-content-harder-to-view-at-a-glance? Can you slide your &amp;quot;Stock Options&amp;quot; widget below the &amp;quot;Tomorrow&amp;quot; widget?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="message-center-puzzle.png">&lt;img src="message-center-puzzle.png?w=169" alt="Message Center Puzzle">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A new lock screen&lt;/strong>
People like lock screens. So they can put functions on them for which you don't have to unlock. Smart, right? Now, people can start playing with your phone without unlocking it, weather you like it or not. Because there is no option to disable that. To make everything easier, we've put more icons on the lock screen, making gestures more finicky. Because we know what &lt;del>Android&lt;/del> iPhone users like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="lockscreens.png">&lt;img src="lockscreens.png?w=450" alt="LockScreens">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And 6789 more features&lt;/strong>
There is much more to discover. The camera app is on 2 locations in the home screen. The message center is as confusing and inconsistent as ever. The new &amp;quot;dots&amp;quot; signal strength indicator, the network operator name, the wifi icon and the new &amp;quot;gprs&amp;quot; icon are now even wider, so they'll never fit the top bar. Sliders switches look bulkier, slide less, but they do change colors as if they were a bulb. You decide what it's supposed to be, let your imagination run wild! A white dot? Is it a slider or just a dot? Who needs aluminum, Try it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you'll excuse us, we're going to sue Sony because they made their Xperia look like our market-leading mobile OS. See?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ios7-because-when-you-paid-for-an-iphone-we-know-you-actually-wanted-android">&lt;strong>iOS7. Because when you paid for an iPhone, we know you actually wanted Android.&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P.S.&lt;/strong> Jony, I'm not sure how much you're involved in the UI design, but if you need help, or a better sparring partner, or I need to come rescue you from the bozos that made you do this, the iPhone 5Cheap with it's non-right-angle old-school injection molded back and the gold iPhone, let me know. You're better than this, and maybe we can still fix things. You know how to contact me.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://http://www.thinkgeek.com/">&lt;img src="binary-pillow.jpg" alt="binary-pillow">
&lt;/a>Suppose you have a Java Server application, and some of the runtime binaries in that application are external to your application. Generated image files, compiled Silverlight components in your pages, or resource files which are managed by an external team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much like the jar files used by your application, these external binaries can be seen as dependencies, with versions. This blogpost assumes your project is built with Maven 2, because the real world &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2012/12/02/the-world-is-not-a-green-field/">isn't always a greenfield project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because Maven is designed around jar file dependencies, and a lot of it's internal decisions are based on file extensions, it looks like this problem can not be tackled with Maven. But there is a way to do this. It will decouple your sub-projects and make version and dependency management much better.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Uploading the binaries files in a remote repository**
&lt;p>The hardest part of this problem is getting the binary uploaded to your maven repository. It seems that there is no other way than disquising it as a jar file, which only leads to confusion. But it turns out that you can, actually upload a .exe file to the repository. To do so,Â place a pom.xml file in the root of the project from which you want to upload the binary file. You do not have to mavenize the whole project, we only use Maven to do the upload to the repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find the file you want to deploy. It can be placed anywhere but I prefer to use the target directory so it looks maven-esque. Make sure you choose the &amp;quot;pom&amp;quot; packaging type so maven does not generate a jar for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;11,16,23,24&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]&lt;project>

&lt;artifactId>executablestuff&lt;/artifactId>
&lt;packaging>pom&lt;/packaging>
&lt;version>1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version>
&lt;name>Some executable component&lt;/name>
&lt;build>
&lt;plugins>

&lt;type>exe&lt;/type>
&lt;/artifact>
&lt;/artifacts>
&lt;/configuration>
&lt;/execution>
&lt;/executions>
&lt;/plugin>
&lt;/plugins>
&lt;/build>
&lt;/project>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you run &amp;quot;maven install&amp;quot;, your exe file will be pushed to your local repository (more on using a remote repository further down).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Downloading the binaries files from the remote repository&lt;/strong>
In the project that will depend on your binary file, you want to copy it from your repository into your target directory at the compile stage. You can do this by adding the following plugin configuration to your pom:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;14,15,16,17,18&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Multiple artifacts in a single dependency&lt;/strong>
When the non-java project produces multiple files with the same extension, you will notice that the trick I just described will not work because you can only specify one file with one extension. This is because maven uses the extension to locate the exact file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to deploy multiple files, it is best you bundle them in a zip and unpack them at the other end. In the non-java project, add the assembly plugin:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;2,15,17&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
&lt;plugin>
&lt;artifactId>maven-assembly-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
&lt;version>2.2-beta-2&lt;/version>
&lt;executions>
&lt;execution>
&lt;id>generate-assembly&lt;/id>
&lt;phase>package&lt;/phase>
&lt;goals>
&lt;goal>single&lt;/goal>
&lt;/goals>
&lt;/execution>
&lt;/executions>
&lt;configuration>
&lt;descriptors>
&lt;descriptor>src/maven/descriptor.xml&lt;/descriptor>
&lt;/descriptors>
&lt;finalName>${artifactId}&lt;/finalName>
&lt;outputDirectory>target&lt;/outputDirectory>
&lt;/configuration>
&lt;/plugin>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use so the zipfile will always have the same name in the target directory, which will make build-helper-maven-plugin configuration easier. It also makes it easier for non-maven scripts to find the file. Upon deploying to the repository, maven will fix the filename so don't worry about that too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The contents of src/maven/descriptor.xml can look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;21,22&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>

&lt;include>*.dll&lt;/include>
&lt;/includes>
&lt;/fileSet>
&lt;/fileSets>
&lt;/assembly>
[/sourcecode]
&lt;p>In the java project, you don't need to change much. Instead of &amp;quot;copy&amp;quot;, you tell the dependency plugin to unzip the file into a directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;3,9,16,18&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]

&lt;/artifactItem>
&lt;/artifactItems>
&lt;/configuration>
&lt;/execution>
&lt;/executions>
&lt;/plugin>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Deploying to a remote repository&lt;/strong>
If the two builds run on two different machines, you may need an external repository. For larger projects, I'd recommend an external, locally managed repository not just for disctribution, but also for speed. Your team will have almost instant access to libraries, speeding up your (initial) builds. Installing a local &lt;a href="http://www.jfrog.com/home/v_artifactory_opensource_overview">jFrog Artifactory&lt;/a> is a good choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make deployment to this external repository work, you need to add the following to your non-java pom file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
&lt;distributionManagement>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- final releases will be deployed to this repository -->
&lt;repository>
&lt;id>artifactory.releases&lt;/id>
&lt;name>Artifactory releases&lt;/name>
&lt;url>http://myartifactory.example.com/artifactory/libs-release-local&lt;/url>
&lt;/repository>
&lt;!-- snapshot releases will be deployed to this repository -->
&lt;snapshotRepository>
&lt;id>artifactory.snapshots&lt;/id>
&lt;name>Artifactory snapshots&lt;/name>
&lt;url>http://myartifactory.example.com/artifactory/libs-snapshots-local&lt;/url>
&lt;/snapshotRepository>
&lt;/distributionManagement>
[/sourcecode]
&lt;p>If you get an error like:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>Error deploying artifact: Failed to transfer file:Â ://myartifactory.example.com/artifactory/libs-snapshots-local/com.rolfje.example/1.0-SNAPSHOT/executablestuff-1.0-20130604.103146-1.pom. Return code is: 401&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Your artifactory is probably not configured to do anonymous deployments. Make sure you can access the artifactory with a userid and password, and add those to the ~/.m2/settings.xml of the machine which will deploy the binary artifacts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I advise to use a special &amp;quot;deployment user&amp;quot; to do this, so you can share this configuration between builds and not depend on a user changig his password. The correct way to store a password for the Artifactory is &lt;a href="http://wiki.jfrog.org/confluence/display/RTF20/Using+Secured+Passwords+in+Settings.xml">explained here&lt;/a>. Â Using the DESede encrypted password on your Artifactory profile page, the maven settings.xml file of the buildserver user can look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
&lt;settings>
&lt;server>
&lt;id>artifactory.releases&lt;/id>
&lt;username>your-repository-username&lt;/username>
&lt;password>{DESede}kIniw826kaluA1OPa865A==&lt;/password>
&lt;/server>
&lt;server>
&lt;id>artifactory.snapshots&lt;/id>
&lt;username>your-repository-username&lt;/username>
&lt;password>{DESede}kIniw826kaluA1OPa865A==&lt;/password>
&lt;/server>
&lt;/settings>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then, of course, you need your java project to know where to download the dependencies so add this to the pom.xml file in your binary project:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
&lt;repositories>
&lt;repository>
&lt;id>central&lt;/id>
&lt;url>&lt;a href="http://myartifactory.example.com/repo">http://myartifactory.example.com/repo&lt;/a>&lt;/url>
&lt;releases>
&lt;enabled>true&lt;/enabled>
&lt;checksumPolicy>fail&lt;/checksumPolicy>
&lt;/releases>
&lt;snapshots>
&lt;enabled>true&lt;/enabled>
&lt;checksumPolicy>fail&lt;/checksumPolicy>
&lt;/snapshots>
&lt;/repository>
&lt;/repositories>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you've reached the end of this blogpost without problems, you should now be able to build your binaries, have them uploaded with correct versions to your external repository, and your Maven/Java build server will download the correct versions of these dependencies at build time. Switching back and forth between tags on your Java project will automatically fetch the correct versions of the binaries, the same way as it does for your jar dependencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy coding!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How big is 5 Zettabyte?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/06/23/how-big-is-5-zettabyte/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2013 19:42:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/06/23/how-big-is-5-zettabyte/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.spyvsspyhq.com/images.html">&lt;img src="3050431703_spyblack_answer_2_xlarge.jpeg" alt="Spy vs Spy">
&lt;/a>Since the interview of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video">Edward Snowden with the Guardian&lt;/a>, the discussion about privacy and companies storing and sharing unencrypted private data is picking up. Particularly Americans are worried about what it does for their National security and their private data. But that's actually a naive thought, given the NSA stores worldwide data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="https://unspy.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/top-secret-nsa-5-zettabyte-spy-building-perfect-surveillence-state-near-completion/">recent coverage on theblaze.com&lt;/a> (a rather tabloid-looking news station in the U.S.), the interviewers are shocked to see that the NSA spies on &amp;quot;every American&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a limited view of the world and failing to see the importance of spying on people &lt;em>outside&lt;/em> the U.S., but lets start with technical side of things first. What data are they storing and how big is their hard-disk?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->As you may know, the internet is a [packet switching network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing). Although people try to mess with the routing and sometimes even [disconnect whole countries](http://www.bgpmon.net/syria-shuts-down-the-internet/), it is hard to make a packet travel a certain route or prevent it from traveling through a certain country. Much of the internet traffic passes through the U.S. regardless of it's source and destination. But even if it didn't, the NSA has that covered. Many companies, Like Facebook, [Google](http://highscalability.com/google-architecture) has [servers all over the world](http://serverfault.com/questions/370385/location-of-google-servers). Since Google and Facebook are companies registered in the U.S. the [NSA could technically indirectly tap into](http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Government/2013/06/09/NSA-Obtains-Data-From-50-Companies) one of their servers in a foreign country which contains data which never travelled through the US in the first place.
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm">worldwide distribution of internet users&lt;/a>, if the NSA wanted to store data just about Americans, they could have built a much smaller, simpler facility. But they didn't, which make you think. So how big is this facility exactly?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**&lt;a href="http://img.pr0gramm.com/2009/04/funny-pictures-cat-looks-at-a-huge-stack-of-crepes.jpg">&lt;img src="funny-pictures-cat-looks-at-a-huge-stack-of-crepes.jpg" alt="Holy Crepe">
&lt;/a>5 Zettabyte**
If you've watched the &lt;a href="https://unspy.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/top-secret-nsa-5-zettabyte-spy-building-perfect-surveillence-state-near-completion/">coverage&lt;/a>, you'll hear James Bamford say that the facility that the NSA is building can hold enough physical machines to store around 5 Zettabyte of data, given current technology standards. It sounds like a lot, but how big is a Zettabyte really?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettabyte">wikipedia&lt;/a>, 5 Zettabyte is 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes.Â If, like me, you can not get your head around a number with 21 zeroes in it, I'll give you some of the calculations I made to understand just how big this is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started with the Internet Archive. Currently, the Internet Archive and it's &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/59207751">Wayback machine holds 10 Petabytes&lt;/a> of data (10,000,000,000,000,000 bytes).Â The servers at the Internet Archive crawl the Internet and store all public data they can find in a searchable manner. They provide the public with that data, so you can do cool things like &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.rolfje.com">see how my blog looked 10 years ago&lt;/a>.Â The Internet Archive is pretty big you might think. With 5ZB, the NSA could store the complete Internet Archive &lt;em>500,000 times&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Relative to world population&lt;/strong>
Ok so maybe the size of the internet, or the size of a Petabyte are not very imaginable. Let's take it to the individual level. At the time of this writing, there are &lt;a href="http://www.worldometers.info">roughly 7.124.855.134 people on the world&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the NSA would wanted to store information on every person in the world, regardless if they were a president or a newborn African child, they would have 701,768,654,374 bytes per person to do so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="5zbperperson.png" alt="5ZB per person">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, they can store 701GB for each person in the world. My personal email archive is around 5GB right now, and I have a 1TB hard-disk containing every (digital or digitized) photo I have ever made. If I would be the standard (which I am probably not), the NSA could very easily store everybody's personal data, worldwide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Relative to the people connected to the internet&lt;/strong>
Not everybody is connected to the internet (in fact that's not entirely true but we'll come to that later). As you have probably already seen on the &lt;a href="http://worldmeters.info">worldmeters.info&lt;/a> site, there are roughly 2,552,435,328 active internet users (at the time of writing). So let's see what the NSA can store if they &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; target the internet users:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="5zbperuser.png" alt="5ZB per Internet User">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ah that's better. Almost &lt;strong>2TB per Internet user&lt;/strong>. The NSA can now not only store my private data, photo's and videos, but now there is room to spare so I can put a couple of blockbuster movies in there, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the NSA probably does some smart data reduction, like storing an email I send to you just once instead of a copy for each of us, I'm guessing the practical space per user will be more like 4TB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YozC8yFrZKI">&lt;img src="p.png" alt="Homer">
&lt;/a>Am I connected to the internet?**
In short: Yes. We are all connected in some way to the internet. Particularly if you are living in a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world">&amp;quot;Western Country&amp;quot;&lt;/a> you can be sure that in some way you, or at least data about your existance, is online somewhere. Cities store data about their inhabitants and share them with other departments and services to do their work. By default, this data travels accross the internet and we all know how good governements are at protecting and encrypting their data, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's do an interesting thought experiment to see how far this goes. Suppose I have never connected to the internet, and neither have you. I own an old &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Corolla_(E70)">Toyota Corolla E70&lt;/a> and you and I stayed with our trusty &lt;a href="http://nokiamuseum.info/nokia-p-30/">Nokia P-30&lt;/a>'s. Now let's say I lend you my car. The NSA would know about that, instantly. How? My car is registered to me. The roads are covered with cameras to detect traffic violations, but in fact, the most governments like to store data about which car is going where. Our cellphones are connected to cell towers, which reveals &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone_tracking">pretty accurate data&lt;/a> about where they are. So the NSA can map the time and place of my car to the time and place of my cell phone and all cell phones I've called. They would quickly and easily discover that my car is moving with your cellphone in it. The fact that their data shows that my cellphone is at home means that you are probably driving my car. Based on our cellphone data, it would even be pretty easy to see our daily commutes, see where you and I work and when and where we met in person.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conspiracy? &lt;em>Maybe.&lt;/em> Possibility? &lt;em>Yes.&lt;/em> Privacy breach? &lt;em>Absolutely.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Different countries have different meanings of the word &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy">&amp;quot;Privacy&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. By definition, gathering of data which is considered to be private (secret or confidential) in the country of origin, is &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage">Espionage&lt;/a>. This is not surprising, as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">old habbits die hard&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I don't care, I have nothing to hide.&lt;/strong>
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5VAgSdGnSQ">&lt;img src="gollum.jpg" alt="Gollum has something to hide">
&lt;/a>Not so fast grasshopper. You do. In fact, the NSA just introduced the very need to keep your data private and store it locally, indefinitely. In the example above, suppose you used my car to take pictures as a hobby photographer of a crime scene that was in the news. With the data they gathered, the NSA could frame either you or me at that scene, at their peril. Because you and I have no access to the data they are storing about us, it will be very hard for you or me to prove that we weren't, because the NSA will not provide you or the court with data that will prove otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same goes for mail and other communications. Tabloid journalists can explain how to use one email, or once sentence from an email out of context to start a nasty gossip. The NSA could do that too. Suppose you are sharing role-playing stories with a friend over email. Those emails could suddenly look very interesting when placed out of context. Don't think they will not do that. &lt;a href="http://www.whereisthemoney.org/1.1trillion.htm">Power corrupts.&lt;/a> They will, and very likely already have done so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_Make_Me_Think">Don't make me think&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
I've always said that the failure to make stuff user friendly is the single most important reason for brilliant ideas to &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/14/nsa-proof-encryption-exists-why-doesnt-anyone-use-it/">fail miserably&lt;/a>. In the light of current events and the power of modern computers, can we at least try to make strong encryption like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy">PGP&lt;/a> stupid-easy to use, and add &amp;quot;coolness&amp;quot; so people will &lt;em>want&lt;/em> to use it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Because much like openness,Â responsibilityÂ and privacy is now more important than ever.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Related material I found while writing this blog post:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish) is a 1975 book by the French philosopher Michel Foucault. If he was still alive, Foucault would probably see that after a period of individualism and consumer-centric change, the NSA is the re-introduction the [Panopticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon), a prison (or society) where the prisoners can not see the guards.
* This Dutch program [&amp;quot;Dare to Think&amp;quot;](http://www.uitzendinggemist.nl/afleveringen/1304898) discusses how Foucault thought, and places it in the modern time. It discusses how modern individualism and a market driven society needs new mechanisms to steer the individual. The theory is in essence that people need to learn to steer themselves and check the self-set boundaries with others from time to time.
* In the source of Windows NT 4 Service Pack 5 a [variable with the name _NSAKEY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAKEY) was discovered which led to speculation that Windows computers could leak private data to the NSA.
* Because few people do, When you decide to use PGP to encrypt your mail, you are likely to gain some attention, particularly from American &amp;quot;authorities&amp;quot;. Because you stand out. If you decide to stand out and encrypt stuff, you better do it right. Gather some information about [Uncrackable Email](http://www.ncmilitia.org/spycounterspy/fs006.html) (yes it's possible). Please note that all your encrypted mails will be stored, so when somebody does find reason to detain you and get your passphrase, deleting your drive will be useless.
* Estimations in the linked articles say that the NSA facility cost $2B to build, has it's own 65MW power station, 60,000 tons of cooling equipment, and an electricity bill of $40M per year (unclear if that includes running their own power station).Â If you looked closely at the WorldMeters link, you could have noticed that there are almost 4 million Cancer related deaths per year and 35 million HIV related deaths, versus [less than 8,000 terrorism related deaths in 2010](http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/09/global-terrorism-deaths). If the NSA is here to pretect us from dying, they'd better use their budget and intelligence to start investigating other stuff.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyWbu2y4QL4">&lt;img src="straight-key.jpg" alt="Straight Key">
&lt;/a>In my morse training adventure on &lt;a href="http://lcwo.net/">lcwo.net&lt;/a>, I hit a slight bump in the road. At Koch lesson 33 (of 40 lessons total), I can't seem to copy with 90% accuracy, which is the criterea for moving to the next lesson. See my downward trend here. It is partly because of gradually speeding up the &lt;a href="http://www.justlearnmorsecode.com/farnsworth.html">Farnsworth timing&lt;/a> from 10wpm to 12wpm so I can be on 20wpm at lesson 40. It is also because of shorter, less focussed daily training sessions, I must confess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="terrible-progress-lcwo.png">&lt;img src="terrible-progress-lcwo.png?w=450" alt="LCWO.net progress">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I experimented a bit, and it seems I can recognize characters easily at &lt;a href="http://cgi2.lcwo.net/cgi-bin/cw.mp3?s=37&amp;amp;e=37&amp;amp;f=600&amp;amp;t=This%20is%2037wpm%20morse%20code%20%20%20%20%5E">37wpm&lt;/a>, but I can't form the words and recognize letters at the same time. More accurately: I can't seem to be able to remember 3 to 5 characters, form a word and listen to new characters at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->To see if this was morse or memory related, I wrote a small program which spells out a text in speech, [NATO phonetic alphabet style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet). I converted some text with it, and proved that my analysis of my own morse problem was correct. This script can also be used to train "word building", so that's why I thought I'd share it with you.
&lt;p>As for me, I am going to switch to morse word training on lcwo.net for a while, see if that helps. Here is the code for spelling out a text using Apple's built-in text-to-speech synthesizer. It takes a single argument as text file:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="screen-shot-2013-05-03-at-20-32-43.png">&lt;img src="screen-shot-2013-05-03-at-20-32-43.png" alt="route.gdb not found">
&lt;/a>On Mac OSX, when installing Garmin BaseCamp 4.1.2 from the Appstore, there is a chance that importing downloaded routes in gdb or gpx files from your local machine will not work. The error you'll get is &amp;quot;[filename].gdb not found&amp;quot;, in a popup much like the one shown here. If you open the console app, you'll see the following error in the logfile:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sandboxd[28092]: ([27931]) Garmin BaseCamp(27931) deny file-read-data /Users/rolf/Desktop
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This means that the OSX Sandbox mechanism does not allow Garmin BaseCamp to read files in that folder. I have briefly searched documentation on how to grant BaseCamp the rights to read files there, but I couldn't find anything that would work. I did find a way to work around this problem though: Garmin BaseCamp does have rights to read your Garmin device. So here we go:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Temporarily copy the files you want to import in Garmin BaseCamp onto your device (or in my case: the extra SD card in the device).
2. Start Garmin BaseCamp, and select &amp;quot;File&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Importâ¦&amp;quot;.
3. Browse to the Garmin SD card and select the gdb file to import. Voila. That will get it into BaseCamp.
4. Delete the gdb file from the Garmin. We don't need it anymore, the Garmin was just a place where BaseCamp could read the file.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From here on, everything should work as normal. This is just a workaround. If anybody finds out how to really fix this problem let me know.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Morse Code is not dead (yet)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/04/09/morse-code-is-not-dead-yet/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Apr 2013 19:40:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/04/09/morse-code-is-not-dead-yet/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaHm1ecBCgw">&lt;img src="international_amateur_radio_symbol.png" alt="International_amateur_radio_symbol">
&lt;/a>Not everybody understands why I am trying to learn &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code">morse code&lt;/a> on &lt;a href="http://lcwo.net/">lcwo.net&lt;/a>. Maybe I'm not even sure myself. But most people seem to think morse code is absolutely dead. I could tell you that's not the case, but it is far better to find out for yourself. To be able to do that you need access to a radio which can receive &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_wave">CW (continuous wave)&lt;/a> signals somewhere between 8MHz and 15MHz. This is the place where &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio_license">HAM Radio Operators&lt;/a> hang out and try to talk to eachother. Morse code is still used there, mainly for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DXing">DX-ing&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do you do that? With the power of the internet and a few very enthusiastic people in Dwingeloo, you can now receive radio signals right on your computer using radios all over the world. Lots of links in this article, have fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->My father is a HAM radio operator . When I was around 16, he had a CEPT Class II license _(I searched the [www.cept.org](www.cept.org) site but for the life of me I can't find an exact description of the license and its entitlements)_. Because a lot of the theory required to get that license was already covered by my study at that time, I decided to get the same class license as my dad. This allowed me to operate on Amateur Radio bands from 50MHz and up.
&lt;p>To be able to operate on lower bands, we had to pass a morse code exam, both sending and receiving. Together with my dad we started listening to 12 words per minute morse courses on tape, and I even joined some on-the-air courses.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that time, there was some talk on removing morse from the exams because it was an &amp;quot;artificial barrier&amp;quot; and a skill which was not really required to operate radio equipment. So on the 1st of September in 2003, the morse requirement was dropped, which immediately meant that my license now covered the HF bands, and I did not have to pass the morse exam. I never looked at morse again. I also never worked on the lower HF bands, stayed mainly on 144MHz and up. My interests gradually changed and for the last 12 years or so, I didn't even look at HAM radio at all. Until I came across this video:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8Ed0TSp0gs]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It made me smile. Morse Code and CW are not dead. I thought it would be fun to see if I could still do that. Well, I couldn't, not even at a much, much lower speed. Which lead me to lcwo.net and here I am, learning morse code again for no other reason than &amp;quot;because I can&amp;quot;. For now I think my goal is to make at least 1 short conversation (called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(amateur_radio)">QSO&lt;/a>Â by HAMs) , with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telegraph_key">straight key&lt;/a>, to another amateur. If not only just so I can say I did that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feGwrW2rT1I">&lt;img src="kenwood-ts50.gif" alt="kenwood ts50">
&lt;/a>I thought I'd do everything low profile, low power (called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QRP_operation">QRP&lt;/a> by HAMs), with a small second hand cheap transceiver like the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oT_rJvVi22I">Youkits HB1B&lt;/a>. But my very supportive dad immediately lent me his &lt;a href="http://www.rigpix.com/kenwood/ts50s.htm">Kenwood TS-50&lt;/a>, so I could listen to morse on the bands. According to &amp;quot;general wisdom&amp;quot; this is not smart because you should not learn from sloppy coders or incorrect speeds. But hey, this is just a hobby. My brother heard I got the TS-50 and dug up his 25 Amps power supply so I could put a full 100 Watts on the antenna, and he also had a 32 meter &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna">dipole antenna&lt;/a>Â for me to use. I can't use that antenna in my apartment building because of practical reasons but that's for another blogpost I think, &amp;quot;How to create a dipole antenna&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few days later, my brother mailed me an awesome link to a site where anybody could listen to these bands, even without a receiver. In 2007, the Radio Club at the University of Twente found a way to make the receiver of the 25m radio telescope available to many people online, while giving every individual user the power to choose a different frequency to listen to. The original goal was to listen to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EME_(communications)">EME signals&lt;/a>, which are sent from earth to the moon, bounce back from the moon's surface and received by the telescope. But the technology of having multiple people use the same receiver over the internet led to something awesome.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the schematics and software were made publicly available and today quite a few people have built receivers with it connected to normal dipole antennas, tuned to the Amateur Radio bands. So if you want to listen to Amateur Radio, or check how much morse is still out there, or even listen to your own signal as it is received by a receiver far, far away, go to &lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.websdr.org/">http://www.websdr.org/&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> and check for yourself. Scroll down for a Google Earth map with all the receivers on there. You do need to have Java enabled for the receivers to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the image below you can see me tuned in on 14.040MHz, on a morse code signal. I usually hear a lot of morse code between 14.000MHz and 14.100MHz. Based on the timing of the dit's and dah's, a lot of people are even still using &amp;quot;straight keys&amp;quot; so I think I can safely connect my old &lt;a href="http://www.mtechnologies.com/junker/">Junker&lt;/a> to the TS50 and get this show on the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="sdr-14mhz.png">&lt;img src="sdr-14mhz.png?w=450" alt="SDR-14mhz">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun playing with your new receivers, kids. See you on air.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open letter to Keith Lang about Skitch</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/01/03/open-letter-to-keith-lang-about-skitch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 22:33:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2013/01/03/open-letter-to-keith-lang-about-skitch/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">&lt;img src="skitch_logo_lockup_blog.jpg" alt="Skitch 1.0.2">
&lt;/a>Dear Keith,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read &lt;a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/11/21/skitch-and-evernote-a-letter-from-keith-lang/">your letter&lt;/a>Â about Skitch and would like to respond to all that has happened from my end-user perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a long-time Evernote user and fan. Evernote changed note taking by being truly searchable. I can confidently drop all the websites, receipts, todos and ideas in there, and clear my mind of the &amp;quot;I must remember that&amp;quot; burden. The OCR of Evernote works beautifully on photos of whiteboards, making even my whiteboard notes searchable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2010, I discovered Skitch. The simplicity and razor sharp focus on anotating a screencapture and share the anotated image by dragging it anywhere was sheer brilliance. My daily work includes making annotated screenhots and mailing them to team members to discuss improvements. Skitch changed this ugly capture-save-edit-save-attach-send cycle to pure poetry in motion. Dragging images into Evernote even made my screenshots searchable. It instantly became second nature and my go-to image tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->As a software developer, I know that software is rarely "finished". There is always that little bug to fix, that missing functionality to add, or some ugly code to refactor. But Skitch was different. It was perfect as it was. It integrated beautifully with everything in my Mac, including Evernote. Not tightly coupled to anything, yet integrated with everything. As a fellow software developer surely you must recognize the poetry in perfect decoupling like this.
&lt;p>When rumors reached me about Skitch being integrated into Evernote I was very worried. Why integrate Skitch into something? It already integrated beautifully with everything on my Mac. Why tie it to some product? I guess the answer is money. Evernote buying Skitch must have been a financially interesting, but I fully expected Skitch to degrade because of that deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first release of Skitch in the Mac App store confirmed all my fears. Skitch 2.0 was so utterly broken, so alien to all users who used or saw Skitch 1.0 on my machine, so crippled, so devoid of it's original focus. Skitch 2.0 left me and some of my colleagues very dissapointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, my trusty Time Machine backup had the old version of Skitch and I quickly distributed it to all the poor users who installed Skitch from the Mac App store. But the damage was already done. Frustrated users, underground distribution of the old version of Skitch to a lucky few. To this day I have not figured out what the &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot; of the &amp;quot;integration&amp;quot; with Evernote is. All blogs and open letters from Evernote and the Skitch team make excuses, link to the old Skitch 1.0.2, talk about how Skitch 2.0 is not Skitch 1.0, but fail to explain what the true advantage is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me, &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">Skitch 1.0.2&lt;/a> is the version of Skitch that truly integrates with Evernote and every other application in a simple, consistent and easy to understand way. It made sharing easy and understandable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sellout to Evernote was the death of Skitch. Sure, some features were added back into Skitch 2.0.2, but only to make Skitch 2 into a cheap knockoff of the once great Skitch 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that Evernote has bought Skitch, sales people will want to integrate it into Evernote even more tightly, migrate it to all platforms, thereby losing some of the tight integration with the OS that made Skitch so wonderful and effortless. Even with all the Skitch 1.0 fans behind you, you will have to fight a board of directors who never used Skitch and want to change it without truly understanding why people loved the old Skitch. The gold handcuffs in your deal with Evernote will prevent you from restoring Skitch to what it was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can only hope that somebody, somewhere realizes how brutally Skitch was butchered by people who clearly did not see the beauty and simplicity of Skitch's userinterface. I can only hope that this person has the skill, means or pure balls to bring the old Skitch back and release it to the Mac App store, maybe under a different name. Just the &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">Skitch 1.0.2&lt;/a>, as is. Screen capture, resize or crop, annotate, your history on the flip-side, and sharing/saving by dragging. Nothing more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, I have Skitch 1.0.2 backed up in every location I can possibly think of. It is an invaluable addition to my daily workflow, and I dread the day Skitch 1.0.2 will no longer work with a new version of OSX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On behalf of all Skitch users out there, thanks for creating the truly amazing, one and only &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">Skitch 1.0.2&lt;/a>. Come over and talk to us. Bring your 1.0.2 sources. We have cookies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why you should not use SOAP Headers</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/12/24/why-you-should-not-use-soap-headers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Dec 2012 18:52:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/12/24/why-you-should-not-use-soap-headers/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="container1.png" alt="container">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the project I am working on right now we use apache XCF and Spring to provide a SOAP service to our customers. As part of the messages, there is a userid/password combo telling the application which user sent the request. I struggled with that today because I think that userid/password info should actually be in the SOAP Header, cleaning up my API, enable me to implement different authentication techniques in the future and generally be more &amp;quot;compliant&amp;quot; to the SOAP standard. Boy was I wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First I needed to figure out how to get the userid/password info into the Header. Apache has [some information](https://cxf.apache.org/docs/ws-security.html) on this which is supposed to be "very good" according to the web but I had quite a bit of trouble because it misses quite a bit of context.
&lt;p>At first, it took me ages to find out that I need to add this to my maven pom.xml file to actually &amp;quot;get&amp;quot; the security stuff onto my classpath:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode type=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
&lt;dependency>
&lt;groupId>org.apache.cxf&lt;/groupId>
&lt;artifactId>cxf-rt-ws-security&lt;/artifactId>
&lt;version>2.5.1&lt;/version>
&lt;/dependency>
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could find NO tutorial online telling me this, so I guess I saved you a good 20 minutes of searching right there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, I needed to change the Spring configuration to &lt;a href="http://www.benmccann.com/dev-blog/apache-cxf-tutorial-ws-security-with-spring/">include the mysterious &amp;quot;WSS4JInInterceptor&amp;quot;&lt;/a> of which nobody understands what it does because it is an overdesigned elephant which implements obscure standards nobody seems to be using:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode type=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
&amp;lt;jaxws:endpoint id=&amp;quot;myCoolSOAPService&amp;quot; implementor=&amp;quot;#myCoolService&amp;quot; address=&amp;quot;/mycoolservice&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&lt;a href="jaxws:inInterceptors">jaxws:inInterceptors&lt;/a>
&lt;ref bean="wss4jinterceptor"/>
&amp;lt;/jaxws:inInterceptors&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/jaxws:endpoint&amp;gt;&lt;/p>
&lt;bean id="wss4jinterceptor" class="org.apache.cxf.ws.security.wss4j.WSS4JInInterceptor">
&lt;constructor-arg>
&lt;map>
&lt;entry key="action" value="UsernameToken" />
&lt;entry key="passwordType" value="PasswordDigest" />
&lt;entry key="passwordCallbackRef">
&lt;ref bean="myPasswordCallback" />
&lt;/entry>
&lt;/map>
&lt;/constructor-arg>
&lt;/bean>
[/sourcecode]
&lt;p>As you can see, the WSS4JInterceptor is configured to accept Usernames and passwords (albeit in deeply, convoluted nested elements adding humongous amounts of XML bloat to your Header).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be able to take the userid/password combo I dutifully started writing my password handler:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode type=&amp;quot;java&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
public class UseridPasswordCallback implements CallbackHandler {&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> @Override
public void handle(Callback[] arg0)
throws IOException, UnsupportedCallbackException {
// Not implemented yet
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>}
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see that my handle(Callback) method is not implemented. And there is a good reason for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just before implementing all the code, I checked the wiring of all this stuff. The application started up beautifully, and I pointed SOAPUI to the WSDL to generate some example requests. To my horror, SOAPUI did not generate example headers. For some reason, the whole CXF stack just &amp;quot;forgets&amp;quot; to put that info in the WSDL, or maybe the specs don't leave room to have that information in the WSDL, I don't know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I set out to see how to build that Soap Security header. It was nuts. Not only did I need to figure this out from crude and incomplete examples, reverse engineer xsd's, and hand-craft it into the SOAPUI messages, I also had to deal with the awful error messages that gave me &amp;quot;Could not read XMReader&amp;quot; and the very helpful &amp;quot;ns1:InvalidSecurity&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After an afternoon of absolute madness on something that should actually be infinitesimally simple, I gave up. I added the userid/password back into the functional calls (as part of my method signatures). And for a couple of very good reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. The first an most important one: If I as a developer have this much trouble wading to the poorly documented, underutilized, astrophysics-level complexity just to add a freakin' userid/password field to a SOAP message, how can I expect my users to ever accomplish this without rage-calling our helpline every 4 seconds?
2. By making the fields part of the API, they become part of the WSDL, which immediately makes it clear what to add and where. SOAPUI even generates nice placeholders for it.
3. I added an Aspect with an around advice intercepting the userid/password combo, use it to authenticate the user and immediately remove the password from memory. Simple, readable, effective and easily debuggable for any developer on the project.
4. The pom.xml and the Spring configuration immediately become much simpler and gets rid of a few idiot acronyms in the process.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>So there. Want to do SOAP Security as it was intended? Do yourself and your customers a favor: Don't.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV12/Home">Devoxx 2012&lt;/a> was nice. 3400 nerds invading Antwerp to talk about new frameworks, languages, and geek out over a set of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">RaspberryPi&lt;/a>'s. But it also confirmed a new &amp;quot;pet peeve&amp;quot; this grumpy old architect is developing.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I am currently working on the largest, most challenging project my company has ever been in. It has a huge codebase, we've been working on it for over 3 years now, and it still is only partially live. During the past years, the market changed, the customer changed it's mind, new tools and frameworks have come and gone.
&lt;p>People come and go too. New developers bring new ideas, new energy, new insights. But before they do that, they troll for a bit. Complaining about the used frameworks not being new and sexy, or the IDE not being to their personal taste. Or the versioning system not being Git. When solving problems, they trust their &amp;quot;instinct&amp;quot; more than they trust the documentation, only to learn the answer was in the documentation all along. It always takes a while for new developers to settle. Maybe it's resisting to change. Maybe it's outside their comfort zone. But the most important: Maybe it's because it has problems they don't have the answer to, and it scares them&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Real projects have real problems. Scaling problems. Load problems. Stupendously boring problems. Problems which upset the customer. Problems that are hard to fix. Because we suck at it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most new languages and frameworks are aimed at solving the developer's problem of having to build a solution fast. But they fail to help in building a fast solution. Because tools don't solve these problems; good technicians do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frameworks need to be abstract to be usable. It's up to us to make it fit the customer's problem. Using big abstraction to build a screen on a single database table is not a real world problem. It generates piles of very generic, inefficient code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of constantly switching frameworks in chasing the performance promise, developers should understand how to buid efficient code, without hiding behind a framework or caching mechanism that supposedly solves that for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Firing a query on a database shouldn't be easy. It should be hard. Because it generates load, and makes your application harder to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like learning new stuff as much as you do, but the reality of today is that fixing, refactoring and expanding an existing project is far more likely than creating a new project. A good developer learns new frameworks and languages. A great developer learns to understand the existing application, the customer and the problem at hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Learning or building a new framework is just procrastinating. Because fixing existing code is hard, and you don't thoroughly understand why it is doing what it does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stop forking. Start fixing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steve Jobs' yacht launched, named "Venus"</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/10/28/steve-jobs-yacht-called-venus-launched/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2012 18:14:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/10/28/steve-jobs-yacht-called-venus-launched/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Today Steve Job's yacht was launched from a dock a few miles from my house. I went there with some friends and we shot some awesome footage of this incredible ship. Through the glass, we could see the 7 iMacs which are used to control the ship. There are also large doors on the side and the back, I suspect these will be used to launch boats or jetskis into a nice warm Mediterranean water.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->We were able to catch a glimpse of it's name on the stern: "Venus". Too bad Steve didn't get to enjoy this. I hope is family and friends have a great time aboard this ship.

&lt;/a> Lorenzo had a great idea. In stead if being one of those &amp;quot;having fun at the bar&amp;quot; ideas that never actually see the light of day, Lorenzo followed through. Did you ever have that urge to just take a gun and shoot that fly that is constantly buzzing around your head or food? Well now you can. Check out his invention at &lt;a href="http://www.bugasalt.com">www.bugasalt.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing his gun, I remembered making pea-shooters at high school from a roll of tape and a party balloon. I adjusted the idea for flies (smaller nozzle), and it works beautifully. It only holds one shot, and it looks not nearly as cool as the shotgun idea of Lorenzo, but if you can't wait to start shooting those flies, here's how to make your own low-budget, one-shot salt shooter. Enjoy!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QawYoignHI">&lt;img src="toyota-iphone-bluetooth.png" alt="Connect your iPhone to your Toyota's Bluetooth system">
&lt;/a>My sisters in law bought a beautiful 2006 Toyota Corolla Verso. They could not get the iPhone to pair with the car's Bluetooth system. The dealer told them that this was an iPhone problem, but after some fiddling, it turns out there is a simple workaround. If you want to pair an iPhone to your car, and the car says &amp;quot;pairing failed&amp;quot; as soon as you tap on your iPhone, this simple trick might help for you. This article contains detailed steps for the Toyota Corolla Verso, but on other cars this might work too.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * &amp;lt;!-- more --&amp;gt;Start the car (don't start driving), and take out your iPhone.
* On the iPhone, tap **&amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot;**, **&amp;quot;General&amp;quot;** and **&amp;quot;Bluetooth&amp;quot;**. Make sure Bluetooth is switched on. Leave the iPhone on this screen.
* Press and hold **&amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;** on the steering wheel of the car.
* When the car says &amp;quot;Setup Menu&amp;quot;, say **&amp;quot;Pair Phone&amp;quot;**
* On the iPhone, tap the **&amp;quot;TOYOTA&amp;quot;** network.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The car will almost immediately say &amp;quot;Pairing failed&amp;quot;. On your phone, the password prompt will show. Do not do anything, let the phone stay on this screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="interior-2008-toyota-corolla-verso-bourgas-pic-2-334.jpg">&lt;img src="interior-2008-toyota-corolla-verso-bourgas-pic-2-334.jpg" alt="Toyota Corolla Verso Dashboard">
&lt;/a>This is because the iPhone probably tries to connect with a default password like &amp;quot;0000&amp;quot;, the car immediately aborts, and doesn't allow a second try. The phone detects the connection failure and will popup a &amp;quot;password&amp;quot; screen for you to enter a number that does work, but the car has already given up. Not to worry, read on:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Â &lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Press and hold **&amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;** on the steering wheel again.
* When the system says &amp;quot;Setup Menu&amp;quot;, say **&amp;quot;Pair Phone&amp;quot;**
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The car enters pairing mode for the second time. Because the phone is still in the &amp;quot;Password prompt&amp;quot; screen, it is already past the detection phase,Â  and will not try to send the default password. Now you can enter your password and the connection will succeed on the &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; try as seen from your car.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * With the iPhone still in the password screen, enter **&amp;quot;1234&amp;quot;** (or whatever password the car tells you) press **&amp;quot;Connect&amp;quot;**.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Congratulations, your phone is now paired.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why developers are never on time</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/06/28/why-developers-are-never-on-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2012 22:14:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/06/28/why-developers-are-never-on-time/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time">&lt;img src="alarmclock.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>If you have worked in IT as long as I do, you probably have noticed that developers have a tendency to not be on time. They are late for meetings, late for lunch, and on other days they are in at 6am or (and) they work until 3am the next morning. If you ever wondered why this is, I might have some answers for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might also find this post interesting if you are trying to figure out why you can't get your time zones working in MySQL.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Today, a customer complained that my use of unix timestamps was unacceptable because it supposedly is not an exact representation of a single point in time. He concluded that after some research he did in the MySQL documentation, and quoted [this text](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/date-and-time-functions.html#function_unix-timestamp) :
&lt;p>&lt;a href="screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-10-22-18-pm.png">&lt;img src="screen-shot-2012-06-27-at-10-22-18-pm.png" alt="Image">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It says that converting a Date/Time to a Unix timestamp is lossy &lt;em>&amp;quot;due to conventions for local time zone changes&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. I am very curious as to what &lt;em>&amp;quot;conventions&amp;quot;&lt;/em> MySQL is referring to in an attempt to hide their buggy time zone implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The example in the MySQL documentation shows how the following two statements result in exactly the same Unix timestamp:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2005-03-27 03:00:00'); SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2005-03-27 02:00:00'); &lt;/code>
If you have worked with Dates and Times for international customers before, you will immediately notice that these two examples are lacking a crucial part, namely the time zone component. In these two cases, MySQL will &amp;quot;guess&amp;quot; the correct time zone for you. Both timestamps represent the crossover between winter- and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Summer_Time">summer time&lt;/a>, depending on what time zone you put behind them (02:00 CEST = 03:00 CET). Apparently the MySQL algorithm for figuring out the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; time zone makes a pretty awful guess here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be able for the client to query the database directly, I needed to come up with a solution. I did some research and found out that the MySQL development team, in their infinite wisdom, chose to not install time zone support by default in MySQL. They also decided that any date/time function you use not so much as peeps about missing time zone support. I will not start a rant on how wrong either of those is. No I will not. Will. Not... Must... not......&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solving the MySQL time zone problem.&lt;/strong>
When you connect to a MySQL instance, it is easy to check if the administrator has installed time zone support. Execute the following query:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>SELECT CONVERT_TZ('2004-01-01 12:00:00','GMT','MET');&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If this query returns the very informative &amp;quot;null&amp;quot;, then time zone support is not installed on your server. Go to the server (or ask your administrator to do this) and execute the &lt;a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html">following commands&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>$ cd /usr/local/mysql/bin $ ./mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | \ mysql -u root mysql -p &lt;/code>
It will give you some useless warnings about unsupported time zones. They should have put that effort in warning us when we try to use time zones. (oops I did it again.. must... not...).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Tested on MySQL 5.5 on Mac OSX as well as MySQL 5.5 on CentOS Linux)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If everything went smoothly, you should now be able to do a time zone conversion with the convert_tz() function. We need time zone support to be able to tell MySQL that our session will now use the GMT time zone. We choose this because Unix Time Stamps are (milli)seconds since 1970-1-1 00:00 &lt;strong>GMT&lt;/strong>. Also, MySQL can not correctly tell the difference between CET and CEST so we steer clear of any summer/wintertime problems it has.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can try our unix_timestamp conversion again:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>set time_zone='GMT'; SELECT @@session.time_zone; SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2005-03-27 03:00:00'); SELECT UNIX_TIMESTAMP('2005-03-27 02:00:00'); &lt;/code>
The first statements sets the time zone, and the second shows your time zone setting. If this does not say &amp;quot;GMT&amp;quot; then either you made a typo or time zone support is not enabled but MySQL &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; to tell you (oh dear, doing it again, am I?). The last two statements should return different Unix Time Stamps, and you should be able to convert back from those into the correct readable (but missing time zone information) timestamps again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the whole problem comes down to MySQL &amp;quot;silently failing&amp;quot; when you use time zones it does not &amp;quot;understand&amp;quot;, and the consistent lack of time zones in the date/time representations, both in the application and in the documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems that a lot of developers on this world still have a hard time grasping that &amp;quot;yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:ss&amp;quot; is never an exact representation of a point in time without a time zone component. Show me a date/time without a time zone and I show you software with time conversion bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our software, we do all date and time conversions ourselves, and store them as Unix Timestamps in in the database as a Long. This way no driver, client or server database will be able to do &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; conversions for us. It helped us develop applications for customers in over 12 countries, spanning a multitude of time zones. The MySQL handling of time zones has reinforced my belief that this is the only way to have total control over dates and times.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to make customers blog about you</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/05/02/how-to-make-customers-blog-about-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2012 21:59:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/05/02/how-to-make-customers-blog-about-you/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="laptopaccuslogo.png" alt="">
An informative article for webshop owners this time, all about how to make people blog about your company. Everything you need to know about online customers, the power of the internet, and how good old moral values still work and can be leveraged to your advantage. Or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->1. Create a website (or two)&lt;/strong>
The first step of every professional online webshop is ofcourse the webshop itself. It should give the customer a good feeling about your customer, and what better than to make the website in the customer's local language? Or, if you really want to go all the way, you can register different local domains, like Lawrence did when he registered &amp;quot;laptop-accus.nl&amp;quot;, and probably a bunch of other domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Combine great presentation with low pricing&lt;/strong>
Create good looking product pages, which are easily linkable, and make it clear to the customer that this is the cheap knockoff, I mean, product he needs. To top it all off, offer your products at an almost unbelievably low price.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="a1175-product-page.png">&lt;img src="a1175-product-page.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Put your company name on the payment receipt&lt;/strong>
When the customer chooses to purchase a product, make sure that your company name is on the receipt. Between all the payments on a credit card bill you want your company to stand out, or at least you want the customer to be able to easily check his payments. Clearly, the &amp;quot;hunt360&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;GB&amp;quot; indicate that this payment is from the &amp;quot;laptop-accus.nl&amp;quot; shop. &lt;em>ahem&lt;/em> Also note the difference between advertized price and the receipt for added customer convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="visa-receipt.jpg">&lt;img src="visa-receipt.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Use a professional looking email address&lt;/strong>
When people contact you for questions or support, your reply says a lot about your company, starting with the &amp;quot;reply to&amp;quot; address in your mail. In this case, Lawrence went all the way, and even used the word &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; in his email address for that extra &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot; touch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="initial-and-only-mail-from-lawrence-censored.png">&lt;img src="initial-and-only-mail-from-lawrence-censored.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. Hire the best shipping provider&lt;/strong>
So you made a local website. But to be able to make some profit, you found a cheap manufacturer in Singapore. So to get products from your manufacturer to the customer, preferably without stocking up, you select the absolute best parcel service you can find. For instance, you can select Swiss post to deliver your parcels, door to door, at an incredible speed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="swisspost-tracking-cropped.png">&lt;img src="swisspost-tracking-cropped.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, you've read those dates correctly. Pretty awesome shipping speeds there. For a handicapped &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_snail">sea snail&lt;/a> traveling over land. And handicapped sea snails tend to get caught at the border, so your customers will always pay that extra import tax you never warned about on your site:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="import-tax.jpg">&lt;img src="import-tax.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6. Promptly answer customer mails&lt;/strong>
In the unfortunate circumstance that your customer is not as impressed with the shipping speeds as you are, make sure you answer questions politely promptly. During the shipping process I asked some questions about why it takes way longer than the advertised 10 days to get my battery, and I got exactly 0 (zero) responses. And I even used the &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; email address! Nothing says &amp;quot;hey I've got your money, now beat it!&amp;quot; like ignoring paying customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7. Let your products speak for themselves.&lt;/strong>
When the customer receives your product, it is your chance to shine. The product will prove itself to be a top-of-the-line knockoff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="nice-fit.jpg">&lt;img src="nice-fit.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case you can clearly see how beautiful it fits the macbook, sitting &amp;quot;perfectly&amp;quot; flush with the body, having the exact same Aluminum color, and immediately is recognized as a brand new, fresh battery by the OS. (NOT, NOT and NOT).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="not-charging.png">&lt;img src="not-charging.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should you think this is not enough, you can add some extra pizzaz to the whole customer experience by leaving the original wholesale receipt in the box. It will tell the customer how much you paid for this cheap knockoff ($30 is â¬22,81).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="actual-wholesale-price.png">&lt;img src="actual-wholesale-price.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you are really the top of the line customer experience perfectionist, you can rig your battery to grow bulges. Is that a battery in your laptop or is it glad to see me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="laptop-bulge-1.jpg">&lt;img src="laptop-bulge-1.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="laptop-bulge-2.jpg">&lt;img src="laptop-bulge-2.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>8. Have a money-back guarantee.&lt;/strong>
When the battery almost explodes, and the customer asks you about your money-back guarantee, politely ignore those mails, just as you did with the shipping inquiries. For good measure, make sure you filter out all messages from paying customers so you can focus on new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Recap:&lt;/strong>
This lengthy article is proof of the fact that you can, in fact, easily convince people to blog about your webshop. Use suspicious names on the receipts, make sure delivery takes weeks or months, ship the cheapest, crappiest products you can find, use a free gmail account to do customer service from, and well, actually, just simply don't do customer service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for my personal story: I have learned to not order the cheapest knockoff battery at some random shop because the price is too tempting. This dead battery arrived a month after ordering, and cost me â¬56,30 + â¬16,87 = &lt;strong>â¬73,17&lt;/strong> instead of the advertized â¬44,-.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I did ask about the refund policy, I doubt I'll ever send this battery back, because I don't expect them to refund me, and I probably will have to pay for shipping, which means more loss. Let's just say that this is an just an expensive way to create material for my blog and helping you make the right buying decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've ordered a proper battery at &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/nl/product/MA348G/A">Apple&lt;/a> for &lt;strong>â¬139,-&lt;/strong> but this time I know there will be no extra charges, it will fit perfectly, and it will just work. Learn from this blogpost and please, please order the original battery from the original manufacturer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy shopping!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mortgage Awareness</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/04/01/mortgage-awareness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 16:41:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/04/01/mortgage-awareness/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This weekend I tinkered around with Apple Keynote. I thought I'd make something useful. In this video I'm trying to show you how much money the bank makes on your mortgage. Banks like you to pay a low monthly fee on your mortgage because it keeps the loan higher for a longer period of time. This way the bank can cash in on the interest rate, and then cash in again at the end of the mortgage contract, when you are still hopelessly in debt.&lt;/p>

&lt;/video>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;Financial advisors&amp;quot; working for the bank will throw sand in your eyes, saying that keeping your debt high gives you all kinds of tax breaks. But in the end, it's them who get better of that construction, not you. Don't fall into this trap.

&lt;/a>Like many people, I like to dine in a good restaurant, where the mood is mellow, the waiter is a fine host, and the cook is passionate about good food and nice presentation. The courses are perfectly timed with your appetite, and each shiny polished plate of food contains the best looking, smelling and tasting food with the nicest textures. After desert, you get the best fresh mineral water coffee, and just sit there, satisfied, happy, in good company. The waiter discretely places the check on the table, and you happily pay whatever that check tells you to pay, and add a big tip for good measure, to show you had a great evening.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->The next morning, you check your bank account and discover there is not much left. Yesterdays meal cost you a bit more than you anticipated. But the memory puts a smile on your face, and you just decide that it's worth it.
&lt;p>At work you tell a colleague about your great meal in the perfect restaurant. He smiles and listens, and asks directions to this perfect restaurant. He drives to the restaurant, looks at the menu and writes down what you had. Then he goes to the supermarket and buys the ingredients for the perfect meal you had. He goes home, and tries is best to cook everything to perfection in his small 1 bedroom apartment while constantly chasing the cat from the kitchen sink. He removes yesterday's dishes from the kitchen table, lights a candle and eats the food. After he finishes his desert he has his Senseo coffee and enjoys the sound of the dryer beeping that it's finished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next morning, he comes in and tells you that you've been screwed. He goes on and on about how he had exactly the same meal, and maybe even more, for about 1/10th the price you payed at the restaurant. Where you had to listen to pre-selected restaurant music, he could choose his own. Where you had to wait for the waiter to bring your courses, he could just pick them from the kitchen sink at will. His meal was so much better than yours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, each time somebody asks about your wonderful dinner, he butts in to say that that restaurant is a ripoff, and how you can have a much better experience with more choice, more freedom, at only 1/10th of the cost. As soon as anybody so much as mentions this restaurant, he starts is rant all over again about how people should not go to that place. What could have been a wonderful exchange of culinary experiences turns into a holy war, where people think they should &amp;quot;win&amp;quot; a discussion, ruining it for everybody,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, in the real world there are very few people so fanatic, going to great lengths to ruin that moment in a conversation where you can tell about the great restaurant you found. Or are there?&lt;/p>

Two laptops. Roughly the same specifications. Still, one of these is almost 4 times more expensive than the other. If you'd own one of these laptops you probably enjoy the choice you've made, for whatever reason. You'd want to tell your colleagues about the wonderful new computer you bought, and how you enjoy working on it, how it looks, how it holds all your music, how easily it edits videos and how it plays HD movies. But most colleagues own their own laptops, and will immediately stop you in your tracks, telling you that you bought the wrong laptop because it's too ugly, can't play a 3D movie, is too expensive or doesn't have that essential megatunderpurplebit connector you've never heard of.
&lt;p>Isn't it funny how computer enthusiasts often forget that they're taking the fun out of each other's story by disapproving somebodies choice simply because that decision is not based on the same criterea?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Motorcycle riders are often very different in that respect. When you drive a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofDllsEV6hE">BMW GS80&lt;/a> Â and pull up next to a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-7gDVmdiDY">Ducati Panigale&lt;/a>, the rider will most likely smile at you. When you compliment him on his beautiful new bike, he will probably return a compliment on the pristine condition of your classic. You can exchange pleasantries about how you enjoy your bikes, without down talking the other guy's bike. He will happily ride along with you for a few miles down a beautiful road, even though he has to make his 195hp supercomputer wait for your reliable mechanical boxer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Motorcyclists &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/13159991">celebrate riding&lt;/a> regardless of sound, style or skill. Cooks celebrate food regardless of price, place or palette. Computer users could learn to celebrate computing regardless of form,Â function or fan noise. Smartphone users could celebrate connectivity regardless of color, coverage or cpu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Respect is only gained by respecting others.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Distributed jMeter through VPN and SSL</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/02/16/distributed-jmeter-through-vpn-and-ssl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2012 21:49:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/02/16/distributed-jmeter-through-vpn-and-ssl/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/lolgraphs">&lt;img src="a-graph.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>This week I created a jMeter test setup for distributed testing. I thought it would be straight forward but I ran into some interesting things you might want to know if you are considering distributed testing using jMeter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case, I had to test an application which was inside our corporate network, while working from home through a VPN and a firewall. Normally that is no problem, but jMeter has this funny construction where the slave (jMeter server) wants to connect back to the master (jMeter gui). It took some fiddling with iptables, the jMeter configuration and ssh tunneling to get it to work. Here's my setup:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;a href="network-setup.png">&lt;img src="network-setup.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting this all to behave nicely wasn't trivial. All the information can be found, but it took me quite some time to piece it all together. If your setup looks like the one above, or if your setup involves having your jMeter master machine on a different subnet and/or behind a firewall, here's what you need to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: Configuring the slaves&lt;/strong>
In most jMeter setups, the slaves are Linux machines (any flavor will do, mine are redhat). Create a &amp;quot;jmeter&amp;quot; user on each of the machines so that you don't have to run the jMeter process as a root user.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [Download jmeter](http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)Â as a zip file and unzip it on each of the jMeter slave machines. At the time of this writing I am using jMeter 2.6.Â Make sure that the files in the bin directory are executable with
chmod +x *.sh jmeter jmeter-server
2. On the first machine, edit the jmeter.properties file in the /bin folder of the unpacked jMeter installation and uncomment the line containing the server.rmi.localport setting. I changed mine to read:
server.rmi.localport=50000
3. Save the jmeter.properties file and copy it over to all the other machines (in the correct location).
4. As &amp;quot;root&amp;quot; user, edit the iptables configuration in /etc/sysconfig/iptables and add the following lines, just above the first &amp;quot;REJECT&amp;quot; line (the order is important here):
# Start jmeter ports
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 1099 -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 1099 -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p udp -m udp --dport 50000 -j ACCEPT
-A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 50000 -j ACCEPT
# End jmeter ports
5. Save the file and while still being root, restart iptables with
service iptables restart
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This covers the work you need to do on the slaves. To test your setup, start the &amp;quot;jmeter-server&amp;quot; application on one of the slaves. Note the address and port the server reports listening to:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Created remote object: UnicastServerRef [liveRef:Â 
[endpoint:[&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#993300;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;10.91.10.11:50000&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;](local),
objID:[-24679ca9:13581440206:-7fff, -1472515273052223306]]]
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From another slave, you can see if the iptables configuration works by telnetting to this slave on port 50000. You'll get connected to the jmeter-server process. Use Ctrl-] to exit telnet (there is nothing useful you could type here). If you get a &amp;quot;Connection refused&amp;quot;, your iptables configuration is not working. Check your steps again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, stop any running jMeter processes on the slaves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: Configuring the master&lt;/strong>
The master is the system where your jMeter GUI will be running, and it is the system that tells the slaves what to do, and where to deliver their results. In order for the master to do that, it needs to be reachable by the slaves. In the network picture above you see a pesky firewall and a VPN server with mis-matching addresses. In order to make this work we're going to tell the master to listen at a fixed port for the slaves, and then do reverse port forwarding to the slaves so they can deliver content to a local port. Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Take the same zipfile you used for the slaves. and unpack it on your master machine. In my case, this is a Macbook, running OSX 10.7.2
2. Edit the jmeter.properties file in the bin folder and list the ip addresses of the jMeter slaves in the remote_hosts property (remove the 127.0.0.1 address) so that it looks like:
remote_hosts=10.91.10.10,10.91.10.11,10.91.10.12,10.91.10.13
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then look for the client.rmi.localport line and change that into:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>client.rmi.localport=51000
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This is all the configuration you need to do on the master. The trick is in starting it all up, read on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: Starting your tests&lt;/strong>
Now that your infrastructure is in place, let's put it to the test. First, from your jMeter master machine, connect to each of the machines using SSH, and setup a reverse tunnel to port 51000 on your master, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ssh -R 51000:localhost:51000 jmeter@10.91.10.11
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Keep each of these sessions open, as the jMeter slave needs to be able to deliver it's test results to your jMeter master.Â On your master machine, open a command prompt and type the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>export JVM_ARGS=&amp;quot;-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>By doing this, jMeter will tell the slaves to connect to &amp;quot;localhost:51000&amp;quot; for delivering their results. This of course ends up being tunneled back to your jMeter master machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, on the master start jmeter.sh, load up your test script and use the &amp;quot;Run&amp;quot; Menu to run the script on one slave, or all slaves together. Remember that the master pushes your test script to each slave and tells it to run it. So if you have a script with a thread group running 10 threads, each slave will do 10 threads, resulting in 40 threads hitting your application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Tips and Tricks&lt;/strong>
During this whole adventure I collected a few handy tips:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Document the whole setup, cookbook style, and put that document in an easy to find spot. There will be a time you have to pass this on to a colleague, and it will help a great deal if he can pick up your document and hit the ground running.
* Put as much of the command line stuff you see above in scripts. In my setup, I have a &amp;quot;connect-slave.sh&amp;quot; script which contains the reverse tunnel trick, a &amp;quot;start-master.sh&amp;quot; which starts the jMeter master with the correct JVM arguments, and a &amp;quot;start-slave.sh&amp;quot; script which starts the slave with a bit more memory. Each slave has 2GB of heap, because I added the following line to the script:
export JVM_ARGS=&amp;quot;-Xmx2028m&amp;quot;
* As much as you need to pay attention to the performance of your application, also make sure that your test script is lean and mean. Some listeners are very expensive to use. The &amp;quot;View Results Tree&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;View Results in Table&amp;quot; are very memory intensive. Great for debugging a single thread, you'll quickly run out of memory for 100 Threads or longer tests. Once you've got your scripts working, disable as much of the listeners as possible.
* jMeter debugging is fidgety. When debugging your script, always do 1 thread and 1 iteration on 1 server. Once that works, you can scale up (don't forget to disable the &amp;quot;View Results Tree&amp;quot; listeners, see above).
* jMeter quickly runs out of memory. Increase the default heap sizes of the master and the slaves by using the [-Xmx JVM option](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/tooldocs/windows/java.html).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Happy Testing!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drobo FS Lion Time Machine Fix</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/01/07/drobo-fs-lion-time-machine-fix/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2012 13:30:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2012/01/07/drobo-fs-lion-time-machine-fix/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xe7bIfj7VM">&lt;img src="drobo-bandaid.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Many Drobo FS owners out there who upgraded to Lion were unpleasantly surprised by the fact that their Drobo no longer behaved like they used to. After months, drobo released new firmware, but it didn't improve things all that much. With the new firmware, the Drobo FS:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * is slow or entirely unresponsive, Time Machine backups don't finish at all or take days
* doesn't show up in the Finder of Lion Macbook owners connecting through wifi
* has a transfer speed of 20MB/s, even when connecting through GB Ethernet, regardless of OSX version (tested with Snow Leopard, Lion)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you have one or more of the problems listed above, you will be pleased to hear that there is a &amp;quot;fix&amp;quot;, although it may not be what you were hoping for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->The Good&lt;/strong>
Late 2010 I discovered drobo. Until then, I had always managed my storage space myself, transferring data to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/">bigger disks&lt;/a> as time went on. The idea of a device which would automatically do that by just plugging in a new drive sounded like a real time saver. That, and the fact that it could handle a disk failure without data loss, and behave like network Time Machine share made me buy a Drobo FS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On December 19th 2010, I spent a whopping â¬615,- on a diskless Drobo, and threw another â¬300,- worth of 1TB disks in there, along with some old disks I had lying around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I moved all &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2010/12/30/move-time-machine-data-to-a-drobo/">backups to the Drobo&lt;/a>. Life would be good. Or so I thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Bad&lt;/strong>
The Drobo does what is called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thin_provisioning">&amp;quot;Thin Provisioning&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. This means that it will tell your computer that it is 16TB in size, although physically it isn't. This means that when you run out of physical storage space, you replace one of the drives with a bigger one and your computer wouldn't even notice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I created a Time Machine share on the drobo, I discovered that this was not entirely true. When you create a Time Machine share on the drobo, you must choose a size in order to keep Time Machine from filling up your drobo. But unlike other shares on the drobo, you can't change the size of the Time Machine share when you decide you need more room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got over it, chose large enough Time Machine shares for all my machines, and everything worked fine for a couple of months. Performance wasn't great, particularly mounting the sparse bundles took quite some time and a lot of disk access on the drobo, but hey. It's seamless automated backup to a redundant disk array so it was acceptable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip forward to July 20th, 2011. The release date of OSX 10.7, Lion. Because I wanted to make sure everything still worked in Lion, I waited until September 2011 before upgrading my Macbook. My other machines are too old and are still running Leopard (OSX 10.5) or Snow Leopard (OSX 10.6).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the reasons I had to wait until September was drobo. They didn't have their software ready for Lion, and drobo actually &lt;a href="http://halmueller.wordpress.com/2011/07/28/drobo-fs-problems-under-mac-os-x-lion/">tried to blame Apple for it&lt;/a>. Yes you read that right. The OSX Lion developer preview had been out since &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-events/october-2010/">October 20, 2010&lt;/a> but somehow drobo didn't seem to have bothered to check compatibility all that time, and as a result effectively bricked all drobo's for Lion users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Ugly&lt;/strong>
After the storm had passed, and Drobo released a firmware upgrade, I switched to Lion on my Macbook after installing the new firmware on the Drobo FS. The Lion upgrade went very smooth and I happily played with Lion's new features. After a few hours, I noticed that the Drobo stopped working. No backups. Yikes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The drobo wasn't visibile when connecting over wifi and at first Lion was blamed for this problem. But my Mac Mini running Snow Leopard also started complaining about not being able to backup. I filed my first drobo support call at 09/18/2011 04:46 AM with the title &amp;quot;New Drobo FS firmware doesn't work with Snow Leopard TimeMachine&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was downhill from there. Drobo support had me throw away Time Machine shares (losing data), reset the whole drobo (losing ALL data on the drobo), install bleeding edge firmware which was not even available through the normal drobo dashboard, advised me to both up- AND downgrade the drobo and the dashboard, repeatedly closed my support calls without actually solving them, refused to answer to replies not coming from the first email address I used, had me send numerous diagnostic files to them, and told me &amp;quot;they were working on a new firmware&amp;quot; but never when it was scheduled for release.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In less than 4 months, I exchanged more than 80 mails with Drobo Support, and the drobo had lost all my data 4 times. It had become more unreliable than any disk I had ever owned before. I was lucky to run backups-of-backups. The drobo may be able to handle drive failures, but the firmware developers and &lt;a href="http://www.stolensnapshots.com/dontdodrobo">drobo support people are a lot less worried about your data&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Fix&lt;/strong>
During these months, I struggled to keep my backups running. On December 13th 2011, I finally bit the bullet and fixed my drobo backup problems. If you want to fix your drobo Time Machine backup problems for once and for all, do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Connect to your drobo with an admin account, and using the Finder, copy all sparse bundles from all Time Machine shares to a location other than the drobo. Do the same for all other data you might have on there.
2. Go the the Apple store and [buy a Time Capsule](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD032LL/A/Time-Capsule-2TB) (as a bonus, this also upgraded my wifi speed a great deal)
3. If you have just one machine you want to backup, plug it in and open Time Machine preferences on your Mac, and choose the Time Capsule as backup location. If you don't want to transfer your old backups, you're done.
4. For more technically inclined people, you can create encrypted and limited size sparse bundles for each of your machines on the TIme Capsule. Read [this article](http://michaelnozbe.com/mac-osx-lion-secure-backup-to-time-capsule-wi) by Michael &amp;quot;Nozbe&amp;quot; Sliwinski on how to do that. It works beautifully.
5. If you want to transfer the data in your old Time Machine sparse bundle from your drobo, you can use [this tip](http://www.unlikelywords.com/2009/01/05/moving-a-time-machine-backup-to-a-time-capsule/)Â to do that, but frankly I haven't tried that, I just created new, clean, backups.
6. Now go and sell your drobo to somebody who doesn't care about his data that much, or just wants a NAS for his Windows machine.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="time-capsule.jpeg" alt="">
The Time Capsule has run beautifully out of the box, doesn't have a butt-ugly dashboard like the drobo's, and is actually faster over wifi than the drobo is over GB ethernet. Go figure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really hope that some day, somebody will create a drobo-like product which actually works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>P.S. If you like a challenge, you can actually already build a drobo-like fileshare with much higher performance at a lower cost by buying an HP proliant server, some disks, installing &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenIndiana">OpenIndiana&lt;/a> on it and run a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS">ZFS array&lt;/a>. A friend of mine has replaced his troublesome drobo with this setup and can reliably copy files to it at 120MB/s over GB ethernet, and swap out drives while he's doing that. Drobo isn't even close.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Pan Rant</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/12/26/the-pan-rant/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Dec 2011 13:42:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/12/26/the-pan-rant/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQu5Unc_TNY">&lt;img src="de-buyer-26cm-carbon-steel-mineral-frying-pan-11546-0-1315069074000.jpeg" alt="">
&lt;/a>You may have seen recent tweets from me ranting about my frying pans. I've ruined a few (very expensive) pans and replaced them with dirt-cheap pans which are actually much better. I would like to share my experiences and solutions with you, so that you can buy the right (cheap) pan without having to go through the same thing. Links to all the pans are in the article below.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->In my household, I try to avoid PTFE (Teflon) coated pans as much as I can. In normal consumer stores, it is almost impossible to find good PTFE-free pans. A few years ago I found two [Calphalon pans](http://www.calphalon.com/pages/home.aspx), a small 20cm frying pan of around â¬90,- (yes you've read that correctly) and a 30cm frying pan of â¬140,- (yes, you've read that correctly too). I convinced the store owner that this was rather expensive for two pans so he "let me have them" for "just" â¬200,- These pans are made of hard anodized aluminum, are scratch resistant and have have pretty good non-stick properties.
&lt;p>After a few years, the large Calphalon pan started to show some black stains on the rim, and I wanted to clean those. I regularly clean the pans with abrasive sponges, but this black stuff wouldn't come off. In a strange (and stupid) last effort to clean it, I sprayed the large pan with oven cleaner. The aluminum started oxidizing, and the pan was ruined. I was pretty upset, but luckily I did it with just one pan (albeit the most expensive one).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_3113.jpg">&lt;img src="img_3113.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Off to the store I went, but this time with a smaller budget. I bought a nice and shiny polished aluminum BK frying pan for â¬30,- . I used it for a few days and very quickly the pan had some brown spots on the rim of the pan. Being polished aluminum, I could not use abrasive sponges here. So I tried all kinds of tricks from this &lt;a href="http://www.omaweetraad.com/">&amp;quot;grandma's advice&amp;quot; website&lt;/a> without the desired results. The last tip I tried was to kook some washing detergent in it, which should dissolve the brown grease. It did not. Instead, it &lt;a href="img_3135.jpg">ruined the pan completely&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Frustrated by the fact that nobody in the world (or at least on &amp;quot;the internets&amp;quot;) seemed to have pan cleaning problems or answers, I started looking for different alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some googling shows that most professional restaurants use rolled steel pans, without any coating. Just plain steel. This is actually pretty funny, when you think about the expensive Teflon and Ceramic coated pans in the stores for well over â¬30,- while professional cooks use steel pans of around â¬20,- which survive many years of heavy use and actually become better and better over time. Professional cooks mostly use gas as heat source, but steel pans can be used on &lt;em>any&lt;/em> heat source, even on induction stoves.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I already have a rolled steel wok, and am very happy with that, so I decided to get a rolled steel &amp;quot;De Buyer&amp;quot; frying pan at &lt;a href="http://www.kookman.nl/nl/pannen/plaatstaal.html?page=shop.product_details&amp;amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;amp;product_id=991&amp;amp;category_id=28">kookman.nl&lt;/a>. I ordered it on a Saturday, and on Sunday they mailed me that didn't have the 26cm pan and offered to send me the 30cm for the same price. That sounded like a good deal so that's what I received on my doorstep on Tuesday. Very good service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before doing any cooking, you have to prepare the pan in order to keep the meat from sticking to the steel. This is called &amp;quot;seasoning the pan&amp;quot; and is really easy to do: Heat the pan, then add oil, and fry some salt in it. There are different methods but salt blackens the pan quicker, I like that. The good thing about a steel pan is that if you screw it up, you can practically sand it down with your abrasive sponge and try again. and again. and again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_3347.jpg">&lt;img src="img_3347.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Here you see my de Buyer pan after seasoning and a few evenings of cooking. This is how your clean pan should look. Washing a non-coated steel pan is generally done without detergent, under extremely hot water with a brush. This keeps the dark &amp;quot;nonstick coating&amp;quot; in the pan. The pans will become darker upon use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you leave the pan dirty overnight, the grease will sometimes come off, or it will start to rust. Don't worry, scrub it and re-season it and you have a new pan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My new steel frying pan will probably outlast me and my kids. And if I can keep the small Calphalon pan away from the oven cleaner, it may do the same thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="imgres-1.jpeg" alt="">
So that's the pan story. But I hear you ask &amp;quot;Why all this trouble? Why not buy a Teflon pan?&amp;quot; Here's why: I don't trust it to be healthy. Teflon is one of the scariest polymers out there, and anybody knows how Teflon coating degrades, leaving little pieces of Teflon in your food.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you search around for the chemical properties of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytetrafluoroethylene">Teflon&lt;/a>, you will find some interesting facts. Meat is usually fried between 200 and 230 Â°C. The thermochemical decomposition of PTFE (Teflon) is detectable at 200 Â°C. If you ever wondered why your canary died early, the degradation by-products can be &lt;a href="http://www.bartcop.com/dead-canary.gif">lethal to birds&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfluorooctanoic_acid">PFOA&lt;/a> is used in the production process of PTFE coated pans to reduce surface tension. Tests with PFOA on laboratory animals showed increased risk of cancer. Recently higher serum levels of PFOA were found to be associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease in the general United States population. This is consistent with earlier animal studies. It is also recently &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/13/us-teflon-component-linked-to-arthritis-idUSTRE76C3WR20110713">linked to Arthritis&lt;/a>. PFOA is a carcinogen, liver toxicant, a developmental toxicant, an immune system toxicant, and also exerts hormonal effects including alteration of thyroid hormone levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, several manufacturers have started selling pans with ceramic coatings and put &amp;quot;PTFE Free&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;PFOA Free&amp;quot; labels on these pans. Why do you think they did that? Maybe it's because PTFE and PFOA aren't all that healthy after all. And apart from the coating in your pan, the production process of PTFE and PFOA is very, very bad for the environment. &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/manufacturing/2005-07-19-teflon_x.htm">Ask Dupont&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turns out, if you know how to treat a pan, &lt;strong>the best coating is no coating at all&lt;/strong>. It's not only healthier and better for the environment, but top chefs will tell you it actually makes your food taste better. Next time you are in an expensive restaurant, ask what pans they use. You'd be surprised.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Review: Lamy Pico pen</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/12/23/review-lamy-pico-pen/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2011 21:00:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/12/23/review-lamy-pico-pen/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="1300_p630491a.jpeg" alt="">
A few weeks ago I saw this amazing pen design by Lamy, the Pico. I'm a heavy computer user so I don't do much handwriting, but I do like nice tools so I thought I'd get this. Particularly the small form factor when retracted and the sleek design attracted me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some things about the Pico that nobody is telling you, so I thought I'd write a little review.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->The pen is nicely packaged and looks really cool in the shop display. I bought it at â¬35,- which is pretty steep for a ballpoint pen. You can probably find a cheaper seller but I haven't seen prices below â¬30.
&lt;p>Aston Martin also thinks the Lamy Pico looks cool. It is a standard part of the Aston Martin DB9 interior. If you can't afford an Aston Martin, you can get the Lamy Pico with Aston Martin logo as &lt;a href="http://www.astonparts.com/lamy-pico-compressible-pocket-pen-d160234.html">&amp;quot;replacement part&amp;quot;&lt;/a>Â so you can show off at the bar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When unpacking the pen you immediately notice the plastic feel and light weight, something you might not expect from a pen that looks like it is made of massive steel. The mechanics of the pen work, but with that same plastic sound and feel. The &amp;quot;stroke&amp;quot; for retracting the pen is rather large and sometimes you have to click twice. Holding the pen in writing position feels strange, because it is &amp;quot;Stubby&amp;quot;. It feels like he writing end of the pen is not tapered enough, blocking your view on the paper.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started writing with it, the black ink would not start to flow immediately. It kept doing this, and it became really irritating. Maybe this pen had been in the shop for a very long time, drying out the ink. It gave me a good excuse to buy a blue replacement cartridge because blue stands out when annotating black printed text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="4014519133803_bum-550.jpeg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my dismay, the â¬2,60 Lamy Pico M22 M replacement cartridge was even worse. The ink does not flow immediately when you start writing, and with this blue cartridge, it stops flowing after 3 words. It actually turns out to be a &lt;a href="http://nopenintended.wordpress.com/tag/lamy-pico/">known problem&lt;/a> with these cartridges. If I had only known beforehand. Here you can see some writing with the Lamy Pico compared with a standard Parker Jotter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_3320.jpg">&lt;img src="img_3320.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can clearly see in the &amp;quot;T&amp;quot; that the ink did not start to flow immediately. After just a 2 words, the M22 cartridge just gives up. Mind you that this is a new, fresh cartridge. The black cartridge I mentioned Â wrote a couple more words before stopping but was worse in starting the ink flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In comparison, the good old Parker Jotter immediately starts putting down dark blue ink and stays consistent all throughout the page. The Parker actually sometimes leaves a little blob of ink, which sometimes smudges when you wipe over it with your hand. But it writes, and that is not what we can say for the Pico.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_3324.jpg">&lt;img src="img_3324.jpg?w=109" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the couple of days I (tried to) use the Lamy Pico at work, I started noticing scratches on the end cap. These scratches are made by the pen itself, from the retracting motion. You can clearly the scratches on the image on the right. This is after just a week of very mild office use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to my cheap but very reliable all steel &lt;a href="http://www.parkerpen.com/en/discovery/range/performance/jotter">Parker Jotter&lt;/a> which has survived many years in my Filofax, has a nice steel feel, a firm &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; and the very reliable Parker replacement cartridges, the expensive plastic unreliable Lamy Pico is no comparison.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Good&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Very nice design with a high &amp;quot;cool factor&amp;quot;
* Fits nicely in your pocket
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Bad&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Looks metallic but feels plastic
* Makes it's own scratches on the end cap
* Too slippery and feels too &amp;quot;stubby&amp;quot; to be an all-day writing pen.
* Refills are of very poor quality. Ink will not start to flow, and stops flowing after a few words so you can not even use it to write a complete sentence.
* Absolutely unusable as reliable pen.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you are looking for a reliable pen with good looks, don't buy a Pico. The cartridges are terrible, and will fail you every time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Useless Machine</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/12/18/the-useless-machine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Dec 2011 09:56:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/12/18/the-useless-machine/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://lunduke.com/?p=429">&lt;img src="images.jpeg" alt="Linux Sucks.">
&lt;/a>Last week, the upgrade to Ubuntu 11 severely broke all carefully selected menu colors, graphics settings and icon sets. I gave up the fight after a few hours of effortless restoration work and switched to Linux Mint 11.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While setting up my machine and restoring the links to the company Windows file servers I could not connect. The password window would re-appear without any feedback. The fix was even stranger than the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->To analyze this strange problem,Â [@sastuvel](http://twitter.com/#!/sastuvel)Â took the keys and tried the following on the command prompt:
&lt;p>[sourcecode light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
$ smbclient //server/Share$ -U DOMAIN\rolf -d 2

did you forget to run kinit?
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course we did run kinit and everything was up and running. No level of debug logging came up with something useful. After staring at this problem of a while I noticed that my hostname was &lt;em>&amp;quot;rolf-Latitude-E6510&amp;quot;&lt;/em>, which seemed a bit long. In a strange last resort voodo-chicken action I edited &lt;em>/etc/hostname&lt;/em> to change it to &lt;em>&amp;quot;dellmint&amp;quot;&lt;/em> and rebooted the machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strangely, this solved the problem. So if you're running Linux (Mint) and have strange problems mounting SMB shares, check your hostname and change it to something simple and short. It might help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And while you're at it, you can also install &lt;a href="http://www.webupd8.org/2011/02/touchpad-indicator-now-automatically.html">touchpad indicator&lt;/a> to disable your touchpad when you plug in your mouse. Why this isn't standard in every Linux distribution baffles me just as much as the blinking wifi indicator.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Having fun at J-Fall 2011</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/11/03/having-fun-at-j-fall-2011/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2011 22:09:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/11/03/having-fun-at-j-fall-2011/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_2973-small.jpg">&lt;img src="img_2973-small.jpg?w=150" alt="J-Fall 2011">
&lt;/a>This year's Dutch Java Nerd event called &lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/">J-Fall&lt;/a> was held in Nijkerk, in a beautiful location called &lt;a href="http://www.regardz.nl/locaties/event-centers/regardz-hart-van-holland-nijkerk.aspx?gclid=CK7bg8zwmKwCFUMm3godUFpdPQ">&amp;quot;Hart van Holland&amp;quot;&lt;/a> . With plenty of sessions by speakers from all over the world it promised to be a great day for Java enthusiasts, at a great location for meeting friends and colleagues. I took a day off from work and it was well worth it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00024/">&lt;!-- more -->Opening by Bert Ertman&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
Bert starts the day by welcoming the 1000+ attendees in the main presentation room in &amp;quot;Hart van Holland&amp;quot;. After explaining what the day is going to bring and where to find rooms, food, drinks, and company booths, he goes on to tell how they tried to get better network coverage. All these nerds with their smartphones in one single place is asking for trouble. It turns out it's too expensive to get good data network so they didn't do that. Network connections proved to be spotty at best in the main building, but I had good 3G coverage outside the main building.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The organizer of &lt;a href="http://www.devoxx.com/display/DV11/Home">Devoxx&lt;/a>Â came by to say hi, and also told us that the J-Fall presentations are being professionally captured and the most popular ones are going to be online soon at &lt;a href="http://www.parleys.com/">parleys.com&lt;/a>. He closed off with the hilarious &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-Cr0EWwaTk">&amp;quot;Java Life&amp;quot; Rap Music Video&lt;/a> . By the way if you liked that, you certainly will like the &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UFc1pr2yUU">&amp;quot;Whole foods Parking Lot&amp;quot; video&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00025/">Java 7 Directors Cut&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
After the cool opening and videos the whole room was ready for some kick-ass sessions. Tomas Nilsson said that he would have a hard time topping the Java Life music video. And he did. Opening with a laughable slide containing a full page mandatory disclaimer text, the presentation was a terrible erratic drive through his very personal memory lane, and after 15 minutes he lost about 80% of the audience. I had absolutely no idea what point he was trying to make, and why nobody advised him to revise his presentation after he gave the same talk at JavaOne. The good thing was that because of the spotty network coverage, not all tweets during this presentation reached the twitter servers, and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/%23jfall">#jfall&lt;/a> was not trending.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the small coffee break we gather around to see what sessions each of us want to join. Scanning the company booths in the main lobby learns that the world didn't change: Booths luring you with pens, mints, stickers, iPads and nice ladies in the booth who are almost always never representing the companies' people or culture. I did score some nice ball pens though :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00071/">Building Highly Scalable Java Applications on Windows Azure&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
Microsoft being a big sponsor of this year's J-Fall, they have to have a keynote. And so they did. And it was a good one. Certainly after the below par presentation skills of Oracle, Microsoft has a nicely polished slides and a demo of Azure, a good story and good pace. During the demo the DNS switching is a bit slow and prevents some things to be shown. At the end of the talk, the speaker confidently retries and it now works. This results in a well-deserved warm applause from the audience. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/doortje123/status/131721454352998400">Well done Microsoft&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00050/">The Java EE7 Platform: Developing for the Cloud&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
With &amp;quot;Cloud&amp;quot; being the new buzzword nowadays, &lt;a href="http://www.java.net/blogs/arungupta/">Arun Gupta&lt;/a> did a keynote on where Java 7 is going, and how applications would fit in this cloud structure. I never heard the term &amp;quot;tenants&amp;quot; being used in this respect, which was interesting. The whole talk was a bit erratic, and after Java EE 6 fixing all the EJB gripes of EJB 3, I couldn't help but feeling that all these &amp;quot;enterprisey&amp;quot; terms are re-introduced in Java 7. The whole idea that you build an application but other people configure the actual building blocks that your application will be instantiated with, is a proven failure to me. Administrators don't have developer knowledge. Changing configuration of key components in your application will severely break it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I came out of this session not feeling to hot about Java 7 and the whole components-in-the cloud and people renting instances idea. Too many roles, academic, over engineered, very Sun Enterprise EJB 2 feeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00066/">Don't call us - we'll push&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
A colleague advised be to go see &lt;a href="http://technology.amis.nl/blog/author/lucas">Lucas Jellema&lt;/a>. Lucas was the first speaker of the day who actually seemed to know what he was doing on stage. Although his slides were a bit crowded, he had a good story with many demos. It was a welcome change after Tomas and Arun, although Lucas didn't have any real new stuff. Polling, long-polls, asynchronus AJAX calls and the old request/response problem in http, and database triggers firing Java programs. Except for &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">Web Sockets&lt;/a> there was nothing new but nice to be reminded how these things actually work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After Lucas' talk we went to get our complimentary lunch. Because we were relatively early, we had no problems getting the lunch package, and enjoyed our tasty sandwiches, milk, apples and Mars. Another free coffee and we're recharged and ready for the afternoon sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00053/">Migrating Spring to Java EE 6&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
&lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulb01">Paul Bakker&lt;/a> &lt;a href="img_2974-small.jpg">&lt;img src="img_2974-small.jpg?w=150" alt="">
&lt;/a>had clearly prepared his slides well, and insisted in giving his talk in English because it would be recorded. I thought this was a nice touch (in case you haven't noticed, I have this idea that everything you want to share with technical people should be in English). Paul explained the tactics to use when converting a Spring application to Java EE 6. Where to start, and how to keep your code compiling while doing the conversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have worked on some large projects and although Paul mentions that some parts of the conversion will take a bit more time than others, I am not looking forward to convert my current 250+ thousand lines of code to Java EE 6 just yet. A plain Spring application may be easy, but as soon as you have Spring AOP, interesting Proxy beans and Custom Factory beans, you'd have to rewrite that code in Java EE6, which could take quite some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I predict converting to Java EE 6 will be much more expensive than upgrading to the next version of Spring for most serious enterprise level applications. I have a home project I'd try to convert first, maybe more on that later on this blog, who knows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00056/">Extreme performance with the Disruptor&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
Although the title and the talk description in the schedule didn't hint too much about it, this talk was 100% about Queues. After some high level talk about Producers, Consumers and Queues, &lt;a href="http://blog.dutchworks.nl/author/allard/">Allard Buijze&lt;/a> drops a bomb and introduces some circle and the name &amp;quot;Disruptor&amp;quot;, without introduction. After a few slides everybody understands that this is some kind of &amp;quot;Circular Queue&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a bit of a laugh when Allard uses 4 slides to explain about dirty cache line reads at CPU level and how the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/">Disruptor&lt;/a> prevents all that, which he then dismisses with &amp;quot;but that doesn't help much&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The talk was entertaining and what I got from it is that the main reason why the &amp;quot;Disruptor&amp;quot; works faster than regular Queues, is that Producers and Consumers can inform each other about their position in the queue, which prevents Queue polling. I can't help but think that this can be done with regular Queue implementations as well, so maybe I missed something here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://www.nljug.org/pages/events/content/jfall_2011/sessions/00058/">Java Tuning Puzzlers&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
For the final session for today most of us decided to go to &amp;quot;Java Tuning Puzzlers&amp;quot;, because it looked like fun. And it was. The presentation by &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/kjkoster">Kees Jan Koster&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jpinpointcom">Jeroen Borgers&lt;/a> was fast, funny, interactive, hands-on and very refreshing. They showed some real-life performance problems they encountered in their work, and asked the audience to solve them. All Java nerds lit up and started shouting answers and funny remarks. Jeroen and particularly Kees Jan were very good in answering questions and snarky comments from the audience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the talk went into overtime and the organization was trying to cut it short, Jeroen and Kees Jan asked the audience &amp;quot;are we going to get beer, or are we going to finish this?&amp;quot;. The whole audience shouted &amp;quot;Finish it!&amp;quot; and we finished the last Puzzler.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No fancy new frameworks, no buzzword bingo, just plain old dry-coding and a plug for one of my favorite tools, findbugs &lt;a href="http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/">http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/&lt;/a> . It was the best session I had all day, and I actually went back to Kees Jan and Jeroen to compliment them with their awesome talk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>
I might sound a bit critical here and there, but I had a great day. Being amongst fellow-nerds, talking tech talk, sharing funny stories, listening to interesting new developments and hearing other people's views on things was really refreshing. Next thing on my list: Try to get Kees Jan Koster to do at least one big main-track keynote at J-Spring or J-Fall next year, about any subject. Because he will at least keep the audience awake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks Bert and all of the NLJug people and sponsors who made this possible. See you all at J-Spring!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="gmail-save-to-disk.png" alt="Gmail save to disk">
Want to save a single email from gmail to disk, in a readable format for Outlook, Thunderbird or Apple Mail? Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open your browser and log into your gmail account.
2. Open the email you want to save.
3. On the top-right, there is a little triangle next to the &amp;quot;Reply&amp;quot; button. Click that, and select [&amp;quot;Show Original&amp;quot;](gmail-show-original.png).
4. The original, raw email opens in a new window or tab.
5. Right-click on this new window, and select [&amp;quot;Save as...&amp;quot;](gmail-save-as.png).
6. When saving the file, make sure the extension of the filename is &amp;quot;**eml**&amp;quot;. So for example [&amp;quot;MyEmail.eml&amp;quot;](gmail-name-it-eml.png).
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>All done. Now you dan open the file in Thunderbird, Outlook or whatever email viewer you have out there and see the original mail, in all it's marked-up glory.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Month view Redesign</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/10/14/month-view-redesign/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2011 21:35:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/10/14/month-view-redesign/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="weekcal-design-icon.png" alt="A day in my week">
True to their tradition on the Mac, the Calendar and Addressbook applications on the iPhone are, let's say &amp;quot;lacking finesse&amp;quot;. As good as Apple can design products and user interfaces, their focus is clearly not on calendars and address books. I've read somewhere that &amp;quot;iCal is proof that Steve does not maintain his own calendar&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After trying out various replacements on the iPhone, I finally stuck with a pretty darn good calendar for the iPhone called &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/week-calendar/id381059732?mt=8">&amp;quot;Week Calendar&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. The main reason for switching to that app is that it actually has a week view, but when I started using it more intensely I found myself using the month view the most. Until somebody at Apple stopped the show.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First of all, let me explain why I like Week Calendar's original month view by comparing it to the original iCal (these are actual screenshots from my actual phone):
&lt;p>&lt;img src="ical-vs-weekcal.png" alt="iCal vs WeekCal">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left, we see Apple's iCal. Apple places a dot on a day where I have appointments. This not very useful for people who have appointments on each day, as you can see. On the right, Week Calendar's colored dots tells me how many appointments I have, and in which Calendar they are (my green calendar is work, my red calendar is private).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other big improvements in Week Calendar's month view are more room for the events of the selected day, the week numbers on the left, the end times of appointments, and the little icons indicating recurring appointments and alarm settings. All huge usability improvements, clearly outperforming Apple's iCal. But suddenly the month view disappeared from Week Calendar. Many users of Week Calendar complained, and the response from UtiliTap was rather surprising:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>"Apple forced those changes upon us, since they have full control over your iPhone and over developers apps. They claim the Day and (old) Month views look to similar to theirs."&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Clearly, somebody at Apple had misinterpreted the rules, and broke a very useful application by using &amp;quot;the force&amp;quot; for no good reason. UtiliTap quickly came out with a release with no less than two month views, the Mini-Month view (which I don't like that much) and a replacement for the original month view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The replacement month view is not as nice as the first one, and I find that it puts more strain on my eyes when I'm using it. I miss the old month view. I had a whole blogpost ready with a rant about how Apple would now have to sue each Calendar maker in the world because their month view looks too much like Apple's month. But I think nobody at Apple is really going to pay much attention to my little rants on this little blog, certainly not now people are grieving over Steve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I decided to think different:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="weekcal-month-design-v2.png">&lt;img src="old-month-vs-redesign.png" alt="Old Month vs Redesign">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left you see the redesigned month view by UtiliTap after Apple bullied them. It's really amazing how quick they were in redesigning this part of the app and releasing it to the app store. But it's clearly a rush job. It doesn't look as polished as the first version, and I think it needs a redesign.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the right you can see my feeble attempt at a redesign. Apart from the obvious cosmetic changes, there is one feature I added: The dots in the top row of a day are before noon, and the dots in the bottom row are after noon. So now you can not only see how many appointments you have and in which calendar they are, but you can also quickly glance over your month to see if you have a free afternoon or morning. Clever, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sent the design to UtiliTap before writing this blog post, and I really hope they use (some parts) of it. I've told them they can use any part of this design free of charge. Because they provided us with an excellent app for an excellent price, and they didn't deserve to be treated by Apple like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm looking forward to the next release of Week Calendar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steve Jobs</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/10/08/steve-jobs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2011 21:01:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/10/08/steve-jobs/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>Dear Apple,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am truly sorry for the huge loss and wish every Apple employee, family, and friends of Steve strength in these tough times. Through Apple, Steve improved the lives of many people in the world, including mine. By hiring great people and (re)building the Apple brand, he will continue to do so even long after his death. Steve lives on in all of us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjf-6p76rhA">&lt;img src="burnmoney.jpg" alt="T-Mobile is scum">
&lt;/a>We all know the stories about how vacationing smartphone users became the victim of high &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roaming">roaming&lt;/a> charges, resulting in monthly bills sometimes exceeding â¬1000. To put an end to this, the EU has come up with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulation_on_roaming_charges_in_the_European_Union">rule&lt;/a> stating that carriers can no longer charge more than â¬50 per month for roaming, and are obliged to warn the user before reaching this limit. That all sounds nice and consumer friendly, but I recently tested this, and received an &amp;quot;interesting&amp;quot; monthly bill from T-Mobile.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I've got an iPhone 4, and like many Dutch iPhone users, I got mine with a T-Mobile contract. I always used Vodafone because it has much better coverage, but when the iPhone 3 came out, T-Mobile was the only way to go and after some hesitation, I switched providers. To this day, the network coverage is not as good as Vodafone's, I miss calls even when I have full bars, and even if I can get "3G", the speeds are not nearly as good as friends with iPhones on the Vodafone network.
&lt;p>Having said that, my contract is an old contract which means I have a truly unlimited data plan, for a reasonable price. That is, until you cross the border.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago, we went to France for a week of Eurodisney with the kids and grand kids. Because of the project stress at work, and de possibility to share pictures with my parents, I decided to enable roaming on my iPhone. I did try to check the T-Mobile site for data plans and bundles, but these were either not meeting my needs (day passes), or were too hard to compare with each other. I checked my contract and the roaming charges seemed only slightly higher than the blocks, box-packs, travel-smurf, stack-bundles, or whatever convoluted pricing schemes these carriers were trying to trick me in to. I decided to reset the usage info on my iPhone and keep an eye on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_2117-all.png">&lt;img src="img_2117-all.png" alt="Welcome to France">
&lt;/a>I crossed the border and received the usual SMS, about rates everybody ignores. I did see that data was â¬2,- per MB (yes mega-byte) but it looked more like a typo to me, surely they didn't mean mega-byte, did they? During my stay in France, I got he absolute worse network coverage and data speeds you can imagine. No matter where I was, reading text-only email turned into a chore taking sometimes minutes to load. Twitter feeds were barely coming through, and sending a downscaled 100kB image actually took several retries, and multiple minutes. It was horrible. And then, on day 4, it all came to a halt. No SMS, no warning, no mail, no phone call, just total data shutdown. I could still make &lt;a href="http://www.rense.com/general79/metal.htm">robot-voice calls&lt;/a>, but all data traffic stopped and I had no idea how to get that going again. And that turned out to be a good thing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_2114.png">&lt;img src="img_2114.png?w=100" alt="Data usage">
&lt;/a>I checked my usage, and guessed that I must have crossed the â¬50,- mark somewhere, and the carrier shut me down to &amp;quot;protect me&amp;quot; from high roaming charges. I tried to SMS a few people to let them know I was still alive, and that was that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks after I got home, I got the bill, and yes, there it was: I had reached the â¬50,- mark. It was an expensive experiment, and well worth this blogpost. Here's why. On my home &lt;a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/consument/internetbellen/start.php">entry-level 8Mbit ADSL connection&lt;/a>, I have free VOIP, and unlimited data. I checked our ADSL traffic and my family seems to be doing about 20GB a month combined. My monthly bill is â¬45,- so if I don't use the phone you could say that a GB of traffic costs me (â¬45 / 20 GB)Â &lt;strong>â¬2,25 per GB.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="factuur_30082011.png">&lt;img src="factuur_30082011.png" alt="The amazing T-Mobile roaming charges">
&lt;/a>As you can see in my data usage screenshot on the iPhone, and the bill on the right, I hardly made use of voice or sms. So we can roughly do the same calculation, assuming that 99% of the bill is data. The monthly bill was â¬89,45, and that got me 31.450MB of data (yes, again: mega-byte). So the price of a roaming Gigabyte in Europe is (â¬89,45 / 0.031450 GB)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>â¬ 2844,20 per GB&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you see is no typo. Almost â¬3000,- per GB. So what the Phone company is telling me here, is that even though the networks in all countries are reaching right up to the border, and we live in an interconnected world where data travels freely across the globe, phone companies charge more than 1000x the regular price to get a bit of information across that border?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think carriers need to be seriously investigated by the EU and Trading committees, because they are using their monopoly to charge us prices which are totally unrealistic. It also proves that privatization of public services like communication networks doesn't work. It nearly always results in a few greedy companies cobbling up a system which delivers crappy service for an outrageous price.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first step for these leeches is to come back from &lt;a href="http://rolfje.com/2010/11/23/why-phone-comps-fail/">whatever cave they were in&lt;/a>, move forward in time to 2011, and replace the &amp;quot;MB&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;GB&amp;quot; on my bill, without changing anything else. That would &lt;em>still&lt;/em> make them 26% more expensive than my internet provider, but at least it would take the roaming charges to an acceptable level, even for the crappy data speeds they blatantly market as &amp;quot;high speed&amp;quot;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Letter to Tim Cook</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/09/20/open-letter-to-tim-cook/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 20:04:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/09/20/open-letter-to-tim-cook/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opt-out">&lt;img src="linked-in-opt-in-1.png" alt="Linked-In, or Opt-out?">
&lt;/a>Recently there was some &lt;a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-ker1.htm">kerfuffle&lt;/a> about LinkedIn silently changing privacy settings. In fact, they didn't do that &lt;em>&amp;quot;silently&amp;quot;&lt;/em>, nor was it &lt;em>&amp;quot;recent&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. Remember that large chunk of text nobody reads with the &lt;em>&amp;quot;Agree&amp;quot;&lt;/em> button you clicked on? Those were the new terms, and deeply buried in them was this privacy settings stuff. LinkedIn's Eric Heath &lt;a href="http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/06/10/privacy-policy-changes/">blogged about that&lt;/a>, bringing it as &lt;em>&amp;quot;more control over your LinkedIn information&amp;quot;.&lt;/em> Sadly, the default setting for this new &lt;em>&amp;quot;control&amp;quot;&lt;/em> is &lt;em>&amp;quot;rather open&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. But you can change that.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Just recently, people started to see the effects of the new terms and conditions, as LinkedIn started a new social advertising campaign including profile pictures. Most LinkedIn users felt they did not (knowingly) agree to that. Ryan Roslansky [explains the new ads](http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/08/11/social-ads-update/) on August 11th, and also mentions that LinkedIn is responding to the complaints and will remove the profile pictures from the new ads.
&lt;p>If you want to be sure that LinkedIn does not use your profile in ads in the future ever again, you could always &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/answers/using-linkedIn/ULI/728753-417696">cancel your account&lt;/a>. For people that don't want to cancel their account, there is a setting you can try to change (given that LinkedIn doesn't change it again). Here's a little screenshot I annotated with &lt;a href="http://skitch.com/">Skitch&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might also want to check out some other settings on those tabs. There's no clear overview, and the settings are hard to click through. That's probably on purpose, because well, Linked-In is now cashing in on it's (or: your) data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpHwCmobz88">&lt;img src="krups_xn20011.jpeg" alt="Click here to see some amazing Latte Art">
&lt;/a>Maybe the title of this post should read &amp;quot;how to open a Krups XN2001 Nespresso machine&amp;quot;. The Krups XN2001 is almost identical to the newer XN2002 and XN2003. While the XN2003 has normal Torx screws, Krups was a bit more &amp;quot;protective&amp;quot; when they built the XN2001. It has screws that can not be gripped by any screwdriver. Still, there is an easy trick you can use to get headless screws out of any machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->My Krups XN2001 Nespresso maker has been working fine for the past few years. I descale it almost monthly with very cheap vinegar, but otherwise it needs no maintenance. Just after I repaired my [free Aeroccino](http://rolfje.com/2011/08/16/aeroccino-motor-replaced/), the power button of the Krups XN2001 started to fail. It was hard to turn the machine on, like there was a bad contact.
&lt;p>When I tried to open the Krups XN2001, I noticed these funny looking screws, which looked more like nails. After I discovered that these were actually normal screws, I needed to figure out how to get to the ones at the bottom.&lt;/p>
&lt;table width="100%" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![Yes, it's a screw, not a nail!](img_2180.jpg)
](img_2180.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![No Dremel in the world could reach those...](img_2181.jpg?w=112)
](img_2181.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
I took the Nespresso machine to a hardware store I frequently visit, and talked to a new hire there. I showed him the machine and he took off on a rant about how I should not open it, that it was dangerous, and it would void the warranty. I told him it was a five year old machine and it was for fun. Just when he got irritated and told me "doesn't matter, you can't open it", a colleague of him overheard our conversation. He looked at the new hire, smiled, and while pointing at me said "but he can".
&lt;p>A few laughs and a short discussion later, it turned out that they did not have tools that would fit or grip the headless screws. I went into &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09UlB17cgKw">&amp;quot;MacGyver mode&amp;quot;&lt;/a> and got an aluminum rod that fit nicely on top of the screw head without touching the plastics of the case, and grabbed a tube of industrial strength superglue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At home, I cut the rod into a few shorter bushings, and used the lathe to make them nice and flat. I carved a slot on the other end of each bushing with a dremel tool. Then, I carefully superglued the bushings onto the screws without touching the plastic, and let them settle for a few minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;table width="100%" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![Super Glue and a bushing. Note the slot for the screwdriver.](img_2183.jpg)
](img_2183.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![Removed screw with the bushing glued to it.](img_2187.jpg?w=200)
](img_2187.jpg)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
After the glue set, it was very easy to use a normal screwdriver to get the screws out. I took the screws with the glued bushings back to the hardware store to show them what I did and got me some new philips head screws with matching size.
&lt;p>Once you open it, you can see how simple this machine is. There's not much that can break, and parts look like they can be easily replaced. Instead of just cleaning the contacts in the button, I decided to go a little further and replaced the existing ones. I had to cut away some placeholders for the old pushbuttons, and drill a hole to hold the green led which tells you what the machine is doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;table width="100%" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![All the electronics. Not much to it, really.](img_2191.jpg)

&lt;/tr>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.perpetualkid.com/beach-vacation-countdown-timer.aspx">&lt;img src="timr-1003.jpeg" alt="Count down to your vacation">
&lt;/a>You know how it is on vacation. You take your camera, shoot pictures, and when you get home you see that you forgot to set the date/time on your camera. Even worse: your wife also took a camera with her, and she actually read the manual and set the time correctly. So now you have two sets of photos with mismatching date/times. Now what?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that there is actually a pretty simple trick to solve this, and you don't even haven to install &lt;a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/index.html">exiftool&lt;/a> or do funny command line voodo. If you have iPhoto and a mouse, here's what you do:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [![The Apple Clock](schermafbeelding-2011-08-14-om-23-13-28.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](schermafbeelding-2011-08-14-om-23-13-28.png)Open &amp;quot;Date &amp;amp; Time Preferences&amp;quot; on your Mac and click on the &amp;quot;Date &amp;amp; Time&amp;quot; tab. You should see a clock like the one on the right. With each camera you took on your trip, take a picture of this clock. You don't have to press the shutters all at once, just do this one camera at a time. It also doesn't have to be your Mac's clock, as long as you shoot the same clock with all the cameras.
2. Import the images of all the cameras in iPhoto.
3. Make smart albums (File, New, Smart albumâ¦)per Camera type. So if you have a Canon and an Olympus, make one smart album called &amp;quot;Canon&amp;quot; with only the Canon's photos in it, and one &amp;quot;Olympus&amp;quot; smart album with only the Olympus photo's in it:[&lt;img src="screen-shot-2011-08-15-at-00-01-57.png?w=300" alt="iPhoto Smart Album for Canon">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>](screen-shot-2011-08-15-at-00-01-57.png)
4. For each smart album, reverse the sort order so that the photo of the clock you just took is the first in the album. (View, Sort order, Descending).
5. Select all the photo's in the &amp;quot;Canon&amp;quot; smart album, open the &amp;quot;Photos&amp;quot; menu, and select &amp;quot;Adjust date and time&amp;quot;. You'll see the clock you shot with this camera in the thumbnail. Copy the time of the clock in the &amp;quot;Adjusted:&amp;quot;field. All other photo's for that camera will be adjusted, because you selected all photo's in the album:[&lt;img src="screen-shot-2011-08-14-at-23-47-15.png" alt="iPhoto set date and time">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>](screen-shot-2011-08-14-at-23-47-15.png)
6. Repeat step 5 for the &amp;quot;Olympus&amp;quot; smart album.
7. Click on the iPhoto &amp;quot;Photos&amp;quot; library where all your photos are. Your photos should now sync up perfectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some caveats with this procedure you should remember:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * This only works if nobody changed the date/time settings in the camera between the time they took the photo's and the time you are importing them in iPhoto.
* When cameras are in different time zones, the times will still be off. You'll have to compensate this yourself by adding/subtracting the timezone difference between the camera and the clock of your Mac.
* Remember to select all photos of a specific camera before adjusting the time, or the trick won't work.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Happy editting!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Add some magic to Eclipse</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/07/30/add-some-magic-to-eclipse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2011 18:40:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/07/30/add-some-magic-to-eclipse/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://nl.toonpool.com/gallery.php?user=406">&lt;img src="harry_potter_31795.jpg" alt="Templatus Expandum!">
&lt;/a>The top feature of the eclipse IDE is the very impressive refactoring possibilities. It makes code feel like play-doh, allowing you to knead it in any shape way or form you think fits the current situation. A close second to that is the impressive templates and code assist. Yes, Java is verbose, but I think 80% of the characters which make up a Java program was never actually typed. All the readability without the labour, brought to you by eclipse's powerful templates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What many people don't realize is that you can easily add to this magic by creating your own templates. One of the first templates I always add to the environment is the one which adds a private static final log4j logger. I thought it would be great example to share with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;java&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
${imp:import(org.apache.log4j.Logger)}
private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(${enclosing_type}.class);
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can add and change existing templates in Eclipse -&amp;gt; Preferences -&amp;gt; Java -&amp;gt; Editor -&amp;gt; Templates. There are other great examples when you scroll through the list, and you can export the templates to a file in your &lt;a href="http://www.rolfje.com/2011/07/03/1355/">shared SpiderOak folder&lt;/a> to have them available on all your machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="screen-shot-2011-07-30-at-20-18-00.png">&lt;img src="screen-shot-2011-07-30-at-20-18-00.png?w=300" alt="Templates configuration in Eclipse">
&lt;/a>Remember to give your templates an easy name so you can quickly invoke them by code completion. Great examples are the existing &amp;quot;sysout&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;foreach&amp;quot; templates. I called mine &amp;quot;llog&amp;quot; with a double-l because &amp;quot;log&amp;quot; collides with too many other code completion possibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Experiment and enjoy your increased productivity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replacing Dropbox with Spideroak</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/07/03/1355/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2011 14:39:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/07/03/1355/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://spideroak.com/">&lt;img src="spideroak-logo.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a>After lies about Dropbox Employees &lt;a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dropbox-updates-security-terms-of-service-to-say-it-can-decrpyt-files-if-the-government-asks-it-to-2011-4?op=1">not being able to see your files&lt;/a>, then proving that they do &lt;a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=821">not do regression testing&lt;/a> on their security, the latest &lt;a href="http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/11/07/02/0515218/Dropbox-TOS-Includes-Broad-Copyright-License">change in terms of service&lt;/a>Â really was the last drop. So I dropped dropbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had become dependent on Dropbox to transfer files between my private and work machines, having my notes, configuration files and (encrypted thank god) password databases handy at all times. Searching around, there is really no other service like it. Although lots of products claim to have the same functionality, the &amp;quot;share this folder between all my machines&amp;quot; feature which dropbox proviced is really unsurpassed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had to find an alternative solution which would meet the following criterea:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. has to be a single, native folder, instantly syncing with all other machines
2. has to be free or *really* cheap, minimum 2GB
3. has to use an encryption technology where no one else can ever read my files, not even the hosting party, not even at gunpoint
4. has to have client software for Windows, Mac and Linux
5. accessing data on my iPhone would be a nice bonus.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After some browsing around, there are two solutions that come close, one is &lt;a href="http://www.wuala.com/">Wuala&lt;/a>, and the other is &lt;a href="https://spideroak.com/download/referral/4b01a22f64d398afbd846637080bd2b4">Spideroak&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>For **one additonal GB of storage for life, [use my referal link](https://spideroak.com/download/referral/4b01a22f64d398afbd846637080bd2b4)** to register at SpiderOak. Read the whole article to add another 5GB to that.&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->Why not Wuala?&lt;/strong>
Wuala looked really cool at first. It looked like they had a native Mac app, and easy syncing between computers. As it turns out, it's nastier than that. The Mac client is effectively a slow Java program in which you need to drag and drop your files to get them uploaded/downloaded. That's not seemless. There is a MacFUSE client that comes with the download, but that affectively makes Wuala into a seperate drive (not a local folder), and the MacFUSE client is low on support, and not compiled as 64bit runtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scanning the Wuala forums, there seemed too much confusion and bugs around the whole software product. Being made by a hardware manufacturer, that doesn't really surprise me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spideroak has native clients for all platforms, and ticks all the boxes in my requirements list, really &lt;a href="https://spideroak.com/engineering_matters#true_privacy">nailing it in the security department&lt;/a>. Spideroak even conforms to my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.com/2007/12/19/if-not-https-then-exit/">&amp;quot;https please&amp;quot;&lt;/a>Â blogpost. A bit of poking around revealed that it is written in Python, and knowing that you can spot some Qt UI elements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Enough talk. How do I get my magically synced folder back?&lt;/strong>
Spideroak is really targeted at backup, and has &amp;quot;sync&amp;quot; as a feature. So in order to get only syncing working, you need to setup a backup for that folder. Don't worry, here are all the steps you need to take to migrate from dropbox to Spideroak:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Cancel your dropbox account as described on the [dropbox help pages](http://www.dropbox.com/help/43).
2. Uninstall dropbox from all your machines. Please note that this will not remove your dropbox folder. Your data will be safe. We can only hope that dropbox will remove that data from their servers, but I wouldn't bet on it.
3. Rename your &amp;quot;dropbox&amp;quot; folder into &amp;quot;Spideroak&amp;quot; if you really want to remove all dropbox references.
4. [Sign up at Spideroak with this referal link](https://spideroak.com/download/referral/4b01a22f64d398afbd846637080bd2b4), and use the promocode &amp;quot;worldbackupday&amp;quot; to increase your storage for free to 5GB for one year, PLUS 1GB of free storage if you used my referal link. That's a total of 6 free GB!
5. Download the client for your platform(s) and install it on all machines where you had dropbox running (no reboot required).
6. After installation, click on the &amp;quot;backup&amp;quot; tab, click on the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; button on the right, and select your Spideroak (former dropbox) folder. Click save. Spideroak should now start backing up that folder.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="1-backup-tab.png">&lt;img src="1-backup-tab.png?w=300" alt="Selecting the sync folder for backup">
&lt;/a>
7. Syncing this folder with other computers is a bit strange in Spideroak, since you need to &amp;quot;pair&amp;quot; folders. I choose to have one &amp;quot;central&amp;quot; computer, which is my Mac Mini, which is always on and will serve as the &amp;quot;center&amp;quot; of the synchronization setup. It does not have to be always on, it's just administrative convenience. You will not notice the difference later on, don't worry.
8. Repeat the installation process on any other computer you removed dropbox from.
9. Now for the crucial part: On one of your computers, click on the &amp;quot;Sync&amp;quot; tab and connect all the Spideroak folders on your machines in one sync job.
&lt;a href="spideroak-sync.png">&lt;img src="spideroak-sync.png" alt="How to synchronize multiple machines with Spideroak">
&lt;/a>&lt;a href="2-sync-tab.png">
&lt;/a> In the screenshot above I have four machines/devices. To add a fifth, I would have to click the little &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; to add a sync folder and select the folder on the fifth machine.
10. Once the backup is complete, Spideroak will start syncing all your synced folders to all machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If everything went as planned, Â Spideroak will now act as dropbox. You'll have a local folder where you can put stuff in, and it will get magically transferred in the background to all your devices. Please note that this will not be as fast as you were used to with dropbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've written a feature request to Spideroak to make a simple client which just syncs a folder to &lt;em>any&lt;/em> machine in the account, without exposing all this setup trickery to the end user. If you want to help promote that feature request, drop them a line and refer to ticketÂ &lt;strong>[SOSÂ #56358]&lt;/strong>.Â Because in the end, all the world wants is a safe, simple dropbox.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From now on, you never have to worry about the brilliant people who invented dropbox, surrounded by the incompitent idiots and lawyers which will ruin the company for good.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goodbye dropbox, sorry to see you go.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Jenkins does not detect Failures</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/06/20/why-jenkins-does-not-detect-failures/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2011 21:04:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/06/20/why-jenkins-does-not-detect-failures/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">&lt;img src="jenkinsnofail.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Jenkins, the brilliant Continuous Integration build server, has a bit of a problem with the Maven surefire jUnit test plugin. Last sunday, I discovered that our Jenkins build server suddenly started ignoring test failures. While the logfile clearly states that the Unittests contain failures, Jenkins marks the builds as &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some digging around, I found that even though Jenkins explicitly tells you in the logfile that it will fail the build, it will not do so if the Surefire XML reports are not generated. In our case, somebody in the team decided that the generation of the XML Surefire reports was taking too long and had disabled them in the Maven pom.xml.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to solve this, I re-enabled the XML reports and voila, Jenkins happily started reporting errors again. Here is the correct Surefire plugin configuration for you to use in your maven pom.xml file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;xml&amp;quot; toolbar=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; wraplines=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; padlinenumbers=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; autolinks=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;10&amp;quot;]
&lt;plugin>
&lt;groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId>
&lt;artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId>
&lt;version>2.8&lt;/version>
&lt;configuration>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> &amp;lt;!-- Please note that Jenkins needs Surefire
XML reports in order for detection to work.
Keep this property set to false. --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;disableXmlReport&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/disableXmlReport&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/configuration&amp;gt;

&lt;p>&lt;a href="search-window.png">&lt;img src="search-window.png?w=150" alt="Eclipse File Search Window">
&lt;/a>As a long time user of Eclipse, I have never understood the any of the tabs of the Search panel in Eclipse. JavaScript search, Java Search, Remote Search, they all make no sense to a modern man who is used to a single search box which searches everything. So I always use the &amp;quot;File Search&amp;quot; Tab, which does exactly what I want 99% of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>File Search always requires mouseclicks. To open the Search window and select the correct tab. It was not until recently that I realized that I could actually reassign the ^H (Control - H) key combination to pop up the File Search tab. If you are an avid Eclipse user you've probably already done this, or know how to do this. If you are new to eclipse, or lazy like me, read on to see how you can re-map this key binding.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>To remap ^H to &amp;quot;File Search&amp;quot;, do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open Eclipse preferences and go to &amp;quot;General -&amp;gt; keys&amp;quot;. You should see the following settings screen:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="eclipse-settings-key-binding.png">&lt;img src="eclipse-settings-key-binding.png?w=300" alt="Eclipse Key Bindings Preference page">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * In the filter text, type &amp;quot;file search&amp;quot;. The command list should now contain only one entry, &amp;quot;File Search&amp;quot;.
* Highlight the &amp;quot;File Search&amp;quot; command
* Click in the &amp;quot;Binding&amp;quot; field and press ^H. You should now see that you've created a conflict with the &amp;quot;Open Search Dialog&amp;quot; in the &amp;quot;conflicts&amp;quot; list on the right.
* Select the conflict you want to remove, and empty the key binding field.
* Press the &amp;quot;Ok&amp;quot; button to close the preferences screen.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now you're all done. When you're in an editor and want to see if selected text is present in other parts of your project&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's say you are looking at Java source of an Ibatis SqlMapClient and want to find the matching statement in any of the the SqlMap.xml files. You can now simply select the text in the Java file, hit ^H, Enter, and voila, you get a list of all files with that same text in it, anywhere in your enclosing project or workspace, without copy-pasting or even touching the mouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now go play with your new found piece of heaven.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Changing the Order of your UnitTests</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/04/01/changing-the-order-of-your-unittests/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2011 21:17:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/04/01/changing-the-order-of-your-unittests/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="toddler-shape-colour-sorting-puzzle.jpg" alt="">
A few months ago we had a problem where Eclipse could not automatically run all jUnit unit tests in a package if that package references a class called &amp;quot;enum&amp;quot;, which is a reserved word in Java 1.6. I'll spare you the details, but we were forced to create a TestSuite. Normally we avoid this construction because it's easy to create a new unit test and forget to add it to the correct TestSuit. So as a workaround we wrote some code which could build and return a TestSuite dynamically. Right-click in eclipse, select &amp;quot;Run as Unittest&amp;quot;, sit back and enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lately this piece of code came in handy while testing another application, which required the removal of data from a database. Yes I know, Unittests should maybe not depend on databases because it leans towards integration testing, but here we are, and I need to solve it. I used the old TestSuite code and changed it so that the TestCase I needed to run first was singled out, while still maintaining the functionality of auto-detecting testcases in the source folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I've cleaned up the code and made an example implementation which sorts the test cases in alpabetical order. It's a simple starting point and definetely not the prettiest code I've ever written but it works, it helped me and it might help you. Copy/paste, and adjust to your own needs.
&lt;p>Have fun!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/webtools/">&lt;img src="wtp_logo_2010.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our company, all Java projects are setup with Maven configuration so that after a &amp;quot;mvn eclipse:eclipse&amp;quot; any developer is generally good to go. One of these projects was a web project but would not transform into a WTP project. By running &amp;quot;mvn eclispe:eclipse&amp;quot; it became a Java project, but could not be added to a Server in Eclipse. It was not a WTP project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learned that the author of the project tried but never got the WTP plugin to work properly. Using the Google, I found more people who are having the same problem converting their existing Maven Java Web projects in Eclipse into a WTP project. There are even a few desperate articles describing how to edit your .project and .classpath files. Oh dear. This calls for an article on &lt;a href="http://www.rolfje.com">www.rolfje.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->It all came down to the maven-eclipse-plugin which would just not configure my project properly. I soon learned that in their infinite wisdom, the development team decided that the maven-eclipse-plugin no longer uses a default value for the _&lt;wtpversion>_ setting. Even if you have theÂ _&lt;wtpapplicationxml>true&lt;/wtpapplicationxml>_ element in your _pom.xml_, without the _&lt;wtpversion>_ tag the maven-eclipse-plugin will ignore all wtp project settings silently. So the solution was rather simple:
&lt;p>**Short answer
**The short answer to this fun evening full of Googling and reading is: Add the &lt;em>&lt;wtpversion>&lt;/em> tag to your maven-eclipse-plugin configuration, run &lt;em>&amp;quot;mvn clean eclipse:eclipse&amp;quot;&lt;/em> and refresh your project. That's it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**The long version
**For people who like to copy-paste (like me):Â Change your &lt;em>pom.xml&lt;/em> file in the root of your project to include the &lt;em>&lt;wtpapplicationxml>&lt;/em> and &lt;em>&lt;wtpversion>&lt;/em> tags as shown at the bottom of this example pom file:&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;/build>
&lt;/project>
[/sourcecode]
&lt;p>Open a command prompt at the root of your project (where the_ pom.xml_ file is) and have maven re-fresh the project, like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;]
mvn clean eclipse:eclipse
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open eclipse, right click on the root of your project and select &amp;quot;refresh&amp;quot; (or press F5).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you've done this, you should have &amp;quot;Web Project Settings&amp;quot; in the properties of the eclipse project. If you right-click on your defined servers in Eclipse, the project should show up in the &amp;quot;Add and Remove&amp;quot; dialog.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why some App Store apps won't install</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/01/09/why-some-app-store-apps-wont-install/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2011 13:37:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2011/01/09/why-some-app-store-apps-wont-install/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://pcweenies.com/tag/mac-app-store-comics/">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-28-53.png" alt="App Store Icon">
&lt;/a>I was happily playing around with the appstore, and came across this funny free game called &amp;quot;Hedgewars&amp;quot;. Originally a free Linux game, it apparently got ported to the Mac and put in the App Store, just as a slew of Flash-based games (yes, Steve has some 'splainin' to do).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to install Hedgewars on my trusty Mac Mini and got this message saying &amp;quot;This Application can not be installed on this machine&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2011-01-08-om-16-45-40.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2011-01-08-om-16-45-40.png?w=300" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->There was no additional information on what was causing this. So the first thing I did was check out my computer information and the requirements for running this game, which seemed to check out fine:
&lt;table width="100%" class="aligncenter" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-00-40-38.png?w=122)
](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-00-40-38.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-15-55.png)
](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-15-55.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
I was running the correct version of OSX, so what was the problem here? My neighbor came over and I showed him this funny problem. He found out that Hedgewars could be downloaded from the developers site, and so we did. After opening the DMG, we were greeted with the funny Application Icon decoration show on the right:
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-18-25.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-18-25.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Usually this means that the application is compiled for a different system than you're trying to run it on. This can happen when you have an older generation PowerPC processor and try to run a non-universal-binary Intel application. So we checked the properties on the application, and it looked like OSX had it wrong. It's an Intel app, and we're running an Intel Mac. So what gives?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step was to open the Terminal so we could dissect this app on the command line, showing it's inner guts. Apps have all kinds of interesting XML and plist files telling the operating system what to do and how to start it up. Here's what we found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;1,2,8&amp;quot;]
rolf@Mac-mini$ cd Hedgewars.app/Contents/MacOS/
rolf@Mac-mini$ ls -l

-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 rolf admin 5913164 27 dec 21:37 hedgewars-server
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 rolf admin 2381240 27 dec 21:37 hwengine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rolf@Mac-mini$ file *

hedgewars-server: Mach-O executable i386
hwengine: Mach-O universal binary with 1 architecture
hwengine (for architecture x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hedgewars package has 3 executables, one 64-bit x86, one i386, and one universal binary which only contains an executable for 64-bit x86. We guess the developers made a bit of a mess of this. As expected, we could start the i386 executable just fine:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;]
rolf@Mac-mini$ ./hedgewars-server
Listening on port 46631
^C
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the x86_64 executable and the universal binary would not start:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;1,4&amp;quot;]
rolf@Mac-mini$ ./hedgewars
-bash: ./hedgewars: Bad CPU type in executable&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rolf@Mac-mini$ ./hwengine
-bash: ./hwengine: Bad CPU type in executable
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because this Mac Mini runs a Core Duo, we figured the x86 was okay, but we weren't sure about the 64-bit architecture. A quick peek at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core">Wikipedia&lt;/a> confirmed our suspicion: The Intel Core Duo is not a 64 bit processor. In fact, 64-bit is the major difference between &amp;quot;Core Duo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Core 2 Duo&amp;quot;. Additional &amp;quot;Googling&amp;quot; showes that &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3696">Apple Support knows that&lt;/a>, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So there you have it. The Mac App Store does not tell you what the problem really is, but chances are that if you get the &amp;quot;Could not install this Application on this machine&amp;quot; error, you have 32-bit architecture (the Core Duo) and the developer compiled the application for 64-bit architecture (the Core 2 Duo).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why in god's name hedgewars has to be a 64-bit application beats me, but that's something I'm not going to change I'm afraid. It turns out that this as been &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/issues/detail?id=147&amp;amp;q=core%20duo">reported as a bug&lt;/a> to the Hedgewars team, which hasn't been picked up yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news for older model Intel Mac Mini Core Duo owners out there: You can replace your CPU with a Core 2 Duo processor. You'll need one of these:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Core 2 Duo T7200 (2.00Ghz)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core 2 Duo T7400 (2.16Ghz)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core 2 Duo T7600 (2.33Ghz).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The processors are quite pricey, our quick check showed that they're all above the $200 price mark, which may be a bit steep for a processor upgrade. We expected about half that, so that was a bummer. Should you want to upgrade your CPU, buy thermal paste, and follow a good howto.Â To get a feeling of what you're getting into, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac-mini-Model-A1283-Teardown/659/1">iFixit teardown of the Mac Mini&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other option would be to trade in your Core Duo Mac Mini for a Core 2 Duo Mac mini. It's safer and probably about as costly as buying one of the strangely priced Core 2 Duo processors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Move Time Machine data to a Drobo</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/12/30/move-time-machine-data-to-a-drobo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2010 21:05:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/12/30/move-time-machine-data-to-a-drobo/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xe7bIfj7VM">&lt;img src="time-machine-drobo.png" alt="Remember, even Drobo's can die. Make sure your files are in at least three different physical locations, one of which preferably off-site.">
&lt;/a>If Santa treated you particularly well this season, or you have put some of your savings to good use, chances are that you have a brand-new Drobo looking at you right now. Meanwhile, your Mac is happily making Time Machine backups to that trusty old local USB disk. So you want to use that new Drobo for Time Machine backups, but don't want to loose history? Here's how (baby steps, no tools required, screenshots included):&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Connect the Drobo (in my case a Drobo FS) to the network and configure an Administrator password for it. You should now have a working Drobo, with at least 2 drives in it, and it shares a &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot; share on the network.
2. Make sure that the free space reported by the Drobo Dashboard is at least as big as your old USB Time Machine drive. Add drives to the Drobo as needed.
3. In the Drobo Dashboard, click on &amp;quot;Advanced Controls&amp;quot;, go to the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; tab, click on &amp;quot;Settings...&amp;quot; and then select the &amp;quot;Shares&amp;quot; tab.
4. Create a new user for your Time Machine backup. It's important to create a non-admin user to keep your data safe. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
5. Create a new Drobo share (the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; on the bottom left), give it a meaningful name and select &amp;quot;Enable Time Machine on this drive&amp;quot;. Be careful in choosing the size, you can't change this later!
6. Remove &amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; from the allowed users for this share (the &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; bottom right) and add the user you just created (the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; on the bottom right). You should now have something like this:[![Create Time Machine share on the Drobo FS screenshot](schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-03-55.png?w=300)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-03-55.png)
7. Close Drobo Dashboard, we won't be needing it anymore.
8. Open System Preferences on your Mac, and select &amp;quot;Time Machine&amp;quot;
9. Click on the &amp;quot;Select Disk&amp;quot; option. Don't worry, we're not damaging or loosing your existing backup by doing this.
10. In the popup, you'll see your newly created Time Machine share on the Drobo. Select this share and fill in the Userid and Password you just created on the Drobo.&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-05-39.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-05-39.png" alt="Select Drobo Time Machine share">
&lt;/a>
11. Wait for Time Machine to start, or force it by using the &amp;quot;Backup now&amp;quot; menu option. Time Machine will first try to create a sparse bundle and calculate what to back up. As soon as you see the backup starting (the &amp;quot;zebra&amp;quot; stripes turn into a normal progress bar), click on the cancel button. We only used Time Machine to create a sparse bundle with the correct settings.
12. In System Preferences, switch Time Machine off.
13. Go to the Drobo Time Machine share you just created and mount the sparse bundle you see there.
14. Open Disk Utility and select the USB Time Machine disk.
15. Click on &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot; and drag the partition of the old USB Time Machine drive to the &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; box. Drag the partition on the mounted Drobo Time Machine disk to the &amp;quot;Destination&amp;quot; box. Double check my screen shot, it's important to get this right. Drag the partitions, not the disks itself. If you're not able to drag the disks as described, you may want to unmount your old Time Machine drive, remount it, and restart Disk Utility.&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-17-22.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-17-22.png" alt="Drag partitions in Disk Utility">
&lt;/a>
16. Make sure &amp;quot;Erase Target&amp;quot; is selected and press &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot;. Disk Utility may ask for your password.
17. Prepare for a long wait. If you have more than a 500GB backup drive, you wish you had invested in Gigabit Ethernet right now (yes that speeds it up tremendously). My restore of 800GB over a 100Mb network took more than 2 days.
18. Once the process is finished, do not forget to switch Time Machine back on in the System Preferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's it. Time Machine will automatically mount the Drobo Share if needed. The first backup will take a bit more time, I think Apple built in a file check to see if the backup is still ok after moving it to another disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Tip 1:&lt;/strong> Keep your old USB Time Machine disk next to the Drobo, even if you have an empty slot. By doing this, you can instantly replace a faulty drive without running to the store. Always keep a spare!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Tip 2:&lt;/strong> Storing data on your Drobo, and then backing up to a Time Machine bundle on that same Drobo is not a backup. A file is only safe if it is stored in 3 different physical locations, one of which is preferably off-site.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Drobo days!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why phone companies will fail</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/11/23/why-phone-comps-fail/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2010 19:34:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/11/23/why-phone-comps-fail/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/phone">&lt;img src="wet-cell-phone.jpeg" alt="cell phone under water">
&lt;/a>I recently had a very unpleasant experience with my mobile phone. Actually, it wasn't so much my mobile phone itself, as it was the sharing of my private mobile phone number between colleagues. Seemingly harmless, but with great consequences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of my colleagues, in his innocence and with nothing but good intentions, shared my phone number with another colleague. As I was sitting in the hospital, the second colleague called me with questions about estimates I made for a project, which at that time &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rolfje/status/545010403512320">intensely frustrated me&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I had the whole weekend to cool down, I was still pretty pissed the following monday. Some unpleasant conversations followed. I think everything is solved now but I can only hope somebody actually deletes my number when he says he does. Which got me to think about the old fashioned and spectacularly broken addressing model phone companies are still using.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->When I was little, there were no mobile phones (yes, I'm that old). People had a single line into their house, with a single number. This situation lead to some "number sharing etiquette": If person A asks for the phone number of person B, instead of giving it, you asked for A's phone number instead, and passed that to B. This way, both parties have control over sharing their number, without you compromising anybody's number without their consent.
&lt;p>Nowadays, it seems that only my &amp;quot;smarter&amp;quot; friends find this etiquette normal to be used in sharing email addresses and other address information. Sadly, this is not the case for the younger generations. Sharing email addresses and phone numbers without asking is common practice. With modern communication methods this is not a problem, because the receiver is in control of the inbound traffic. Messages can be blocked, filtered or re-routed. Mails can be routed to different folders or straight into the trash with a simple mail rule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much unlike unlike messaging, routing incoming calls is not possible on your phone. Why? Because the phone companies have created a problem when they introduced caller-ID.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of protecting the receiver of the call, they chose to protect the caller by hiding his number if he wishes to do so. This simple oversight results in the receiver not being able to route calls based on caller-ID. I can not block anonymous incoming calls without knowing if I am missing important calls, say from the hospital.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to fix this, I propose we do the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. We still keep (or re-introduce) the sharing etiquette described above, because I think it is good courtesy to handle other people's data with respect. It's also a workaround for the inbound routing problem.
2. We create a system where a phone can have multiple numbers, of which the owner can route traffic. Google voice is already doing this, but european phone companies are not allowing that to happen over here (guess why).
3. We loose the whole &amp;quot;anonymous calling&amp;quot; idea after implementing 2. As with MSN and Google Talk, I get to see who is calling me, and I can choose to block future calls or add you to my &amp;quot;buddy list&amp;quot;.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Having said all this, I think phone companies are dying. Sure they're doing okay now, but they keep holding on to old landline business models and apply them to new technology. It will fail like it is failing for the music and film industry right now. Unless phone companies act up and start behaving more like reasonable &amp;quot;data/Internet providers&amp;quot; they will be replaced by internet providers putting up cell towers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until then, we need to put up with (but protest against) ridiculous data plans, absurd roaming charges, single-provider GSM towers with coverage problems and the recent &amp;quot;round up to nearest minute&amp;quot; method of over-billing customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I expect all this to happen not earlier than world peace, let's be careful about sharing each others numbers, shall we?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Anonimatron featured on Softpedia</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/09/26/anonimatron-featured-on-softpedia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2010 19:08:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/09/26/anonimatron-featured-on-softpedia/</guid><description>

&lt;p>When you drive a Prius (like me), and you always have your lights on (like me), you probably have been irritated by the dimmed speedometer and unreadable display in bright sunlight (like me). If you didn't read the owners manual (like me), you also probably didn't know about this trick to get the brightness back (like me). Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td width="33%" valign="top" >

&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1238&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;100&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;Voila, full brightness.&amp;quot;]&lt;a href="img_0242.jpg">&lt;img src="img_0242.jpg?w=100" alt="">
&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
You need to do this every time you start the car or turn on/off the lights.

The towel bin is next to the sink. Why would anyone walk all the way back to the toilet to throw their paper towel in there? Well maybe it's because they have nowhere to put it?

&lt;p>&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-40-16.png" alt="Recalculated route (green) does not match the original (pink)">
I've been struggling to get routes into my Garmin ZÅ«moÂ® in such a way that it matches the plans of the original author, while at the same time setting the Garmin to &amp;quot;recalculate&amp;quot; so that when I take a wrong turn, it will send me back to the track. After reading a lot on the Garmin forums, and experimenting with this on my two recent road trips (one to Eifel and one to Sauerland in Germany) I can say I have found a way to do this. It's a bit of work, but it will make your trip a lot more trouble-free. Here's the recipe.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Needed:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Nice motorcycle route in a GPX or GDB file&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="http://www8.garmin.com/support/download_details.jsp?id=4435">Garmin BaseCamp&lt;/a> (BaseCamp 3.0.1.0 for OSX at time of writing)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=135&amp;amp;pID=15000">Garmin ZÅ«moÂ®&lt;/a> (model 660 at time of writing)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;!-- more -->**Before you begin:**
&lt;p>Open &amp;quot;Preferences...&amp;quot; in Garmin BaseCamp on the Mac and make sure you selected &lt;em>&amp;quot;Shortest Dinstance&amp;quot;&lt;/em> on the routing tab. This is to prevent routing errors because of changed maximum speeds on different maps. Speeds may differ, but distances are always the same.
On the ZÅ«mo, make sure you matched the BaseCamp routing settings as well as you can.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1. Import the route&lt;/strong>
You friend sends you a file with a great motorcycle route, in this case &lt;em>&amp;quot;Demo.GPX&amp;quot;&lt;/em>
You import the file into BaseCamp by clicking on &lt;em>&amp;quot;File&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Import...&amp;quot;&lt;/em> and selecting the file. Basecamp loads the route and it shows up as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-26-19.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-26-19.png?w=450" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Copy the route&lt;/strong>
In order to make sure your ZÅ«mo will re-calculate the route as your friend intended it, you may need to correct for mismatches in maps, software versions or settings influencing the calculation. To correct the route, we copy it. Select the imported route (it will highlight on the map), right click it and select &lt;em>&amp;quot;Duplicate&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. You should now have 2 routes in the List on the left side of the screen:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-33-11.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-33-11.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, right click the copied route (in this case &lt;em>&amp;quot;Demo Route 1&amp;quot;&lt;/em>) and choose &lt;em>&amp;quot;Get Info&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. On the &lt;em>&amp;quot;Summary&amp;quot;&lt;/em> tab, choose a different color for the copied route, so we know what we are editing. In this case, I choose green.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Recalculate and fix the copy&lt;/strong>
Close the info screen and right-click the copied route again, this time choosing &lt;em>&amp;quot;Recalculate&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. To demonstrate what happens when settings differ, I exported the route with the (wrong) &lt;em>&amp;quot;Shortest Time&amp;quot;&lt;/em> setting, and imported/recalculated it with the (correct) &lt;em>&amp;quot;Shortest Distance&amp;quot;&lt;/em> setting. We see that the copied route is now recalculated and does not match the original:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-40-16.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-40-16.png" alt="Recalculated route (green) does not match the original (pink)">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because your friend will likely be riding the pink route, you want to correct your copy of the route so that both BaseCamp and the ZÅ«mo will send you down the roads you intended to ride. You can do this by selecting the &lt;em>&amp;quot;Selector Tool&amp;quot;&lt;/em> and dragging the green route towards the purple one. Each time you do this, it will create a new waypoint in your copied route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-42-51.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-42-51.png" alt="Selector tool">
&lt;/a>When placing a new waypoint, try to avoid placing waypoints on intersections. This will give both BaseCamp and the ZÅ«mo more room to choose different routes, which you don't want. Think of it this way: You want to be driving on a certain road, not on a certain intersection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you think you are ready, zoom in to about 300m level, and carefully scan the route so that you can correct the final details of the route. Because we selected different colors, the differences are easy to spot, and it's easy to see how to correct them. This is what it looks like when making corrections, note that I'm dragging the new waypoint to the middle of the road, as mentioned earlier:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-49-20.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-49-20.png" alt="Dragging waypoint to correct route">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Fine-tune the waypoints&lt;/strong>
After the route looks as intented, you need to make sure that the waypoints are placed perfectly on the road. This is particularly important on 2-way highways, where a misplaced waypoint can make your ZÅ«mo think you want to be riding in the other direction on this highway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Right-click the copied route and select &lt;em>&amp;quot;Get Info&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. If not already selected, choose the &lt;em>&amp;quot;Via Points&amp;quot;&lt;/em> tab and place a checkmark on the &lt;em>&amp;quot;Center on Selected&amp;quot;&lt;/em> option. Now click on the first waypoint, and see if it is placed exactly where you want it to be. If it is not, press the &lt;em>&amp;quot;alt&amp;quot;&lt;/em> (also calledÂ &lt;em>&amp;quot;option&amp;quot;)&lt;/em> key on your keyboard and use the Selector Tool to drag the waypoint to the correct location. Below you can see a misplaced waypoint that needs to be corrected:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-52-51.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-06-16-om-20-52-51.png?w=450" alt="Misaligned waypoint">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. Export the route&lt;/strong>
If you placed the copied route in the same List as the original route (like in this example), you might want to delete the original route from the list (or from your Collection if you choose), and save the resulting list into a GPX file. This is an extra safety measure, giving you a backup of the route to take along on your trip on an SD card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You have 2 options in BaseCamp for transporting the route to the ZÅ«mo. Either you send it directly to the device, or you save the exported GPX file onto the SD card in the &lt;em>/Garmin/GPX&lt;/em> folder. Doing the latter will enable you to recover from a crashing ZÅ«mo, because you can re-import the route from the SD card.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6. Check the imported route in the ZÅ«mo&lt;/strong>
Whether you exported it directly to the ZÅ«mo, or you put it onto the SD card, a few seconds after booting the ZÅ«mo will tell you that it found new user data. You choose &amp;quot;import&amp;quot; and select the route(s) you want to import. I did notice that selecting &amp;quot;&lt;em>Import all&amp;quot;&lt;/em> for larger routes, the ZÅ«mo tells you after 5 routes or so that it failed. This is probably a memory problem. Importing them one-by-one nearly always works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the route is imported and you're still behind your Mac, you might want to compare the route in the ZÅ«mo with the one on your screen. In some cases the ZÅ«mo is still stubborn enough to select a different route. Most of the time this is because of incorrect settings in the ZÅ«mo, causing it to avoid ferries or take the faster route.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Have fun!&lt;/strong>
The most important thing of all this work is to have fun. No matter where Garmin sends you, remember that you're on your bike to have fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Growth is a bad thing. Bad.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/05/17/why-growth-is-a-bad-thing-bad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 May 2010 21:58:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/05/17/why-growth-is-a-bad-thing-bad/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="petri-dish.jpg" alt="">
Quite often I am amazed at people's ability to miss what looks obvious to me. Not only the small things like cleaning up when you spill coffee over the floor, or washing your hands when you get off the toilet, but also bigger things. Like the silly &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; to the world's pollution problem for example.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looking to solve our pollution problem by changing people's behavior is one of the things which to me is obvious to fail. Although some behavior may speed up pollution, in the end we all pollute, wether we like it or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the risk of writing a very unpopular blogpost, I'd like to share some thoughts on the ongoing and ever increasing pollution problem. In my eyes, there are 2 real causes of pollution, and ultimately these causes are even self-repairing although you may not like how that works out for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->Growth&lt;/strong>
If you've watched &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Way_Round">&amp;quot;The Long Way Round&amp;quot;&lt;/a> you've noticed that farmers in Mongolia have nothing but their animals and the land they live on. To them, there is a natural balance between people and nature. Having more of one thing (regardless which) disturbs the balance of things and renders pretty immediate problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the &amp;quot;modern world&amp;quot; this balance is less obvious, and the urge to &amp;quot;want&amp;quot; something is not naturally stopped. People always to want have more. Bigger house, bigger car, more money, more kids. It is the constant urge for a &amp;quot;better life&amp;quot;. This urge, combined with the unimaginable stupidity of people in large groups have lead to a system which is based on &amp;quot;Growth&amp;quot;. If you don't believe me, stare at the &lt;a href="http://www.worldometers.info/">worldometers web site&lt;/a> for a while.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any rational thinking person must see that endless growth results in an infinitely large system. Since the earth has a fixed size, any system based on &amp;quot;Growth&amp;quot; is bound to hit the limits of what is physically possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Waste production&lt;/strong>
Every living thing on this planet produces waste. This can be in the form of breathing out co2, or taking a dump behind a tree. Nature has a way to deal with this. Waste is decomposed, and therefore part of the system. In fact, everything on this earth is part of &amp;quot;the system&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to Merriam-Webster's online dictionary, &amp;quot;pollution&amp;quot; is &lt;em>&amp;quot;the action of polluting especially by environmental contamination with man-made waste&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. Oversimplified and on a (very) large scale, we can not produce stuff that's not here. Everything is synthesized in some way from existing materials. In my mind, &amp;quot;pollution&amp;quot; is just &amp;quot;waste with a longer recycle time&amp;quot;. Even &lt;a href="http://www.mnn.com/technology/research-innovations/blogs/boy-discovers-microbe-that-eats-plastic">plastic eventually breaks down&lt;/a> and re-enters the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil">Wikipedia&lt;/a>, oils are &lt;em>&amp;quot;classified as mineral oils because they do not have an organic origin on human timescales&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. So what it says is that Oil is in fact a natural product, but because it took so freakin' long to become oil, we don't recognize it as a natural product. What it says to me is, if we are able to find the balance, we may be able to keep using oil, as long as it's in the same rate as it is reproduced. Mind you, that's an incredibly slow rate, to &amp;quot;human timescales&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we want to keep the earth as &amp;quot;healthy&amp;quot; as it is now, we can introduce the following rule of thumb:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>n x p = r&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>where:
n = number of people on the planet
p = pollution per person per month
r = Earth's natural pollution recycle rate, per month (constant)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>So, if you want to have twice the people, you need to pollute half as much, on average, because the earth's natural recycle rate is fixed. I'm sure this formula is nowhere near a realistic model, but it shows that both increasing consumption and increasing the world's population is not going to work out in the long run.Â Even if Â everybody &amp;quot;sees the light&amp;quot;, becomes an environmentalist, stops driving cars, and cuts down on consumption in general, we can't continue to endlessly grow our population.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Spot the Similarities&lt;/strong>
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Extrapolated_world_population_history.png">&lt;img src="extrapolated_world_population_history1.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>So now we understand that this &amp;quot;Growth&amp;quot; system is resulting/has resulted in too many people on this planet, producing too much long lasting waste at a high rate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, it get's scarier. Let's look at the growth rate of the human population on this planet. Several graphs, including this one from wikipedia, will show relatively slow population growth until the 1920's. Between 1920 and 2000 we see exponential growth. After that, it is expected that the growth will decline into a more &amp;quot;stationary&amp;quot; phase.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmmm now where did we see that before? Remember biology class, particularly the lessons about bacterial growth ? In this next graph, you can see the different phases of bacterial growth, resulting in certain death of the complete population, due to the depletion of resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://onlinebiologybook.blogspot.com/2009/01/microorganism-exam-1.html">&lt;img src="06-14_bacteriagrowth_11.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Guess what we're doing? By getting more and more kids, our population &amp;quot;eats&amp;quot; all the natural resources at a rate at which the earth can not match. It can not produce enough new resources to maintain the population, effectively resulting in a petri dish which also doesn't &amp;quot;replenish&amp;quot; it's resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, this painfully demonstrates that any system based on &amp;quot;Growth&amp;quot; is a system doomed to fail. Having kids to support your pension might seem like a good idea, but essentially you're sacrificing the life of your kids (or theirs) for your comfortable retirement days. In my (unpopular) opinion, the only (and I mean &lt;em>only&lt;/em>) way to reduce the whole pollution and economic problems is to have less people on this world. Much, much less. In fact, we would see quicker results if particularly modern &amp;quot;western&amp;quot; people shrunk in numbers first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Unpopular measures are... unpopular
As mentioned before, people are loosing the ability to stop giving in to any urge they get. One of these urgesÂ (albeit strongly driven by nature itself) is having kids.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please understand that I have nothing against kids, in fact I'm a grandfather myself. It's just that I think it's funny that we actively encourage having kids, while at the same time recognizing that people are the very cause of all these environmental problems in the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We continue to stick our heads in the sand and talk aboutÂ &lt;em>&lt;em>cough&lt;/em>&lt;/em> &amp;quot;Co2 neutral flying&amp;quot;, &lt;em>&lt;em>rhrmhhhrrm&lt;/em>&lt;/em> &amp;quot;Bio degradable rubber&amp;quot; and last but not least, the hilarious &lt;em>&lt;em>COUGHcoughcough&lt;/em>&lt;/em> &amp;quot;Renewable energy&amp;quot;. What we should really think about is how to at least stop the world population from growing. This may result in imposing all kinds of unpopular/impossible worldwide measures I don't care to get into right now, but killing is of course not one of them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since no politician is going to win voters by saying that he wants the whole country to be celibate (or worse),Â I realize that this will probably never happen, at least not in my lifetime. Â The good thing is that our weak minds aren't forced to make these choices, because the system will make the choice for us. Just like the petri dish does for bacteria.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I'm not the most environmental friendly freak you'd encounter, maybe even far from that with my motorcycle, car, computers, and airconditioner. My point is actually that we probably can keep enjoying a lot, if not all of these things, if we just stop putting more and more people on this world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe I can best put it like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;If you love kids, stop having them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Please note that nothing in this post is meant to be personal or offensive to anybody in any way. It's just a silly blogpost in which I think aloud. Use it as food for thought, or discard it, but don't let it spoil your day. Don't worry, I don't have the power to control my kids, or even my cat, let alone the world. I have no intentions to becoming a politician.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Installing Wubi 9.10</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/04/23/installing-wubi-9-10/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Apr 2010 20:40:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/04/23/installing-wubi-9-10/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-04-23-om-22-20-17.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-04-23-om-22-20-17.png?w=150" alt="Why I HATE Linux">
&lt;/a>Ok, fist of all: DO NOT DOWNLOAD WUBI 9.10 as it contains a serious GRUB2 problem which will give you some headaches if you're new to Linux. Why I'm saying this? I just ran into this GRUB2 problem while installing the new Wubi 9.10. Here's what I did:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Downloaded Wubi 9.10 windows installer and ran it.
2. Installer downloads stuff, and boots into Ubuntu installer
3. After reboot, GRUB screen comes up with a loud beep and a prompt. Great.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Some googling finds a lot of Linux voodoo talking l33tspe4king nerds, but it did contain some info with which I managed to get things working:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->At the GRUB2 screen, Â issue the following _(italic)_ commands (things in red you have to figure out yourself, sorry. _&lt;tab>_ means press the tab key for autocompletion.):
&lt;p>X=0 and Y=1 in most cases (Wubi install on C:)
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>ls (hd__X&lt;/em>_,&lt;strong>Y&lt;/strong>)_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The long HEX string at the end of the line you get back is the UUID, you'll need that later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>insmod ntfs&lt;/em>
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>set root=(hd__X&lt;/em>_,&lt;strong>Y&lt;/strong>)_
grub&amp;gt;_search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set _&lt;em>UUID&lt;/em>
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>loopback loop0 /ubuntu/disks/root.disk&lt;/em>
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>set root=(loop0)&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if X was 0:
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>linux /boot/vmlinuz&lt;/em>_&lt;tab>__ root=/dev/sda__Y__ loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk ro_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>if X was 1:
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>linux /boot/vmlinuz&lt;/em>_&lt;tab>__ root=/dev/sdb__Y__ loop=/ubuntu/disks/root.disk ro_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>initrd /boot/initrd.img&lt;/em>_&lt;tab>_
grub&amp;gt;&lt;em>boot&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should now see the normal Ubuntu. Log in with the user information you entered in the windows wubi installer, and start the update manager. This will get your GRUB2 installation updated (partly).

In some biker magazines you'll see some cheap journalists write that the &amp;quot;dish washing soap anti-fog is an urban myth&amp;quot;, and that it will &amp;quot;blur your vision&amp;quot;, some may even say it's downright dangerous. This blogpost is to show that if done right, dish washing soap is actually the absolute best anti-fog treatment money can buy. If you've tried this and still don't like it, there are some easier alternatives at the bottom for your convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Why this post**
&lt;p>The Netherlands. AÂ damp and cold country where even the most high-tech coated visors fog up at the most inconvenient moments. Particulary at the start of this season it was terrible. Because of the longer and colder than normal winter, I was very eager to get on the bike early. As soon as the snow was gone, I was riding. Because I forgot to take care of the visor, it fogged up. Badly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went out to find ways of preventing the fogging up of the visor. A friend told me that pinlock works, but when the airtight seal is gone, you're in deep trouble. It also adds extra layers of Lexan, meaning more glare. Then, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cityjohn">@CityJohn&lt;/a> pointed me to FogTech wipes. I ordered a few at &lt;a href="visorvision.co.uk">Visorvision&lt;/a>, and got them very promptly (customer service is A-ok at Visorvision, thanks again Paul!). The wipes work as advertised and add almost unvisible glare to the visor. Good value for money, but the wipes themselves dry out quickly. To keep the effect you have to re-apply the coat, but you will rarely find yourself using the same wipe twice. Not that the price is a problem, but it may become a burden on roadtrips.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my surprise, I found a longer lasting solution on my kitchen sink. I heard of the dish washing soap tip before but never actively tried it. To my surprise, with a little care, you can coat the inside of your helmet with this stuff, it will be invisible, and will stay on for at least a week. Even better: your visor will actually become clearer when you breathe against it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Before you do anything:&lt;/strong>_ Check if your visor has a special coating. If this is the case, you are probably better off just cleaning it according to the owners manual. If you're not sure, try this stuff on a small unused part of the visor._&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: Clean your visor&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_1175&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;140&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;The clean visor should fog up evenly when breathing against it&amp;quot;]&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-04-19-om-21-30-46.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-04-19-om-21-30-46.png?w=200" alt="">
&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before applying any product to your visor, you need to carefully clean it. Taking the visor off and washing it with a soft detergent is probably best. On the road this can be a bit more problematic, so you might want to consider taking a damp sponge with you in a watertight bag, and some dry wipes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can test if your visor is clean by breathing on it. If it fogs up nice and evenly, it's clean enough for the next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: Apply (very little!) dishwashing soap&lt;/strong>
Take a soft rag (cotton t-shirt or such) and put a small Â drop of washing up liquid on it. The less you apply, the easier the final step will be.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
**Step 3: Buffing**
Take a new, clean, soft rag and gently rub the inside of your visor. You'll see the detergent disappear, and the visor will become clear. As soon as the visor is clear, stop. You don't want to remove all the detergent.

&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
Now try it. Put your helmet on, close the visor and breathe on it like your neighbors dog after a run in the park. It will not fog up. Nice huh? Imagine how many coats you can do with one bottle of dish washing soap? And you don't even have to take it on the road trip, because every household, hotel or grocery store will have this!
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advanced tips:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. After a while, very small dirt particles from your breath will attach to the detergent. This can be seen as a light mist, like you also see on the inside of the windshield of your car. You can re-buff the inside of the visor at least once before re-applying the soap, but it has to be absolutely dry before buffing.
2. When you are riding, you might notice you didn't buff the inside quite enough. If it bothers you too much, breathe against your visor to clear it up. Yes, with soap on the visor it will actually become clearer when breathing against it.
3. If you don't have the time to do all this, and are going for quick-and-easy, I'd recommend the FogTech wipes, as mentioned earlier.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Ride safely.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Simple Strict Date Parsing</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/03/06/simple-strict-date-parsing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Mar 2010 23:00:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/03/06/simple-strict-date-parsing/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="calendar-icon2.png" alt="">
In Java, the &lt;em>DateFormat.parse()&lt;/em> method is a funny little critter. It helps you by trying to figure out what date you actually meant when you typed in &amp;quot;35/12/2O10&amp;quot; (note the letter &amp;quot;O&amp;quot; in 2O10). In this case, it will parse the date without errors or warnings, and returns the date &amp;quot;11/12/04&amp;quot; (November 12th, 0004). That's because it thinks &amp;quot;35&amp;quot; is a month, and &amp;quot;2&amp;quot; is the year, ignoring everything after the letter &amp;quot;O&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>DateFormat&lt;/em> tries to convert the &amp;quot;35th month&amp;quot; into 2 years and 11 months, and correct the date accordingly. &lt;em>df.setLenient(false)&lt;/em> prevents this, but that still leaves the problem of the parsing stopping at the first wrong character without warning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I needed a much stricter way of parsing dates, and yesterday I found an elegant solution to this problem. It's so small I was able to &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/rolfje/status/9828355998">tweet it in less than 140 characters&lt;/a>, but I thought it deserved a decent blogpost so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>`&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public Date parseDateString(String inputDateString)
throws ParseException {
DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.SHORT);
Date parsedDate = df.parse(inputDateString);
if (!inputDateString.equals(df.format(parsedDate))) {
throw new ParseException(&amp;quot;Invalid Date&amp;quot;, 0);
}
return parsedDate;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>`&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The brilliance here is in the comparing of the formatted date with the original input. The method returns a normal ParseException so you can perfectly replace your original &lt;em>df.parse()&lt;/em> calls with it, making them more strict.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to Bas for this elegant and simple solution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ibatis Inline Parameter Maps</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/02/16/ibatis-inline-parameter-maps/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2010 15:19:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/02/16/ibatis-inline-parameter-maps/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="box.jpg" alt="">
Today I (re)discovered a feature in the Ibatis data mapper framework which was clearly documented, but for some reason was not being used in our project. The feature is called &amp;quot;inline parameter maps&amp;quot; and combined with a wrapper bean it can clean up a lot of clutter in the code and in the SqlMaps. Please feel free to share this example with your fellow Ibatis Data Mapper 2 framework users.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**The Case.**
&lt;p>Suppose you are building software to interface with an old Oracle backoffice for a big parcel delivery company. One of the Classes you are using is the &amp;quot;Box&amp;quot; class, which is a basic Java Bean:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public class Box {
private int height;
private int width;
private int depth;
private int weight;
private String color;
private String origin;
private String destination;
&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#888888;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[... getters and setters here...]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You need to store a Box object using a stored procedure in the backoffice. The stored procedure, called &amp;quot;store_box&amp;quot;, returns the location code of the Box, but you do not want to store this location code in the Box object.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Parameter Class.&lt;/strong>
To solve this problem in Ibatis, you can use an aggregating parameter object called &amp;quot;StoreBoxParameters&amp;quot; (or any name you like). This is a simple bean which aggregates the Box object you want to store, and has extra fields for the data returned by the &amp;quot;store_box&amp;quot; stored procedure:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public class StoreBoxParameters {
private Box box;
private String locationCode;
public StoreBoxParameters(Box aBox){
this.box = aBox;
}
&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#888888;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;[... getters and setters here...]&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To store the Box object, you write an SqlMap which calls the stored procedure with a parameter map:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;parameterMap id=&amp;quot;storeBoxParameterMap&amp;quot; class=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.StoreBoxParameters&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.height&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;NUMERIC&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.width&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;NUMERIC&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.depth&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;NUMERIC&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.weight&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;NUMERIC&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.color&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;VARCHAR&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.origin&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;VARCHAR&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;box.destination&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;VARCHAR&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;IN&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;locationCode&amp;quot; jdbcType=&amp;quot;VARCHAR&amp;quot; mode=&amp;quot;OUT&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/parameterMap&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;procedure id=&amp;quot;store_box&amp;quot; parameterMap=&amp;quot;storeBoxParameterMap&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
{call store_box (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)}
&amp;lt;/procedure&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And in the DAO, you can now fetch the locationcode seperate from the Box object:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public String storeBox (Box aBox) {
StoreBoxParameters boxParameters = new StoreBoxParameters(aBox);
getSqlMapClientTemplate().update(&amp;quot;store_box&amp;quot;, boxParameters);
return boxParameters.getLocationCode();
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that this solution becomes even nicer when you have to call a stored procedure with multiple IN and OUT parameters and you want to separate these your business objects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the solution for the first problem, you may have noticed the stored procedure call in the Ibatis SQL map being written as &lt;em>&amp;quot;{call store_box (?,?,?,?,?,?,?,?)}&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. This is not exactly elegant, particularly when you have a long list of parameters. When bug fixing, it is hard to see which value gets passed into which parameter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Inline Parameter Map.&lt;/strong>
In the Ibatis data mapper documentation, I found a beautiful solution for this, called inline parameter maps. First, you delete the parameter map from the SqlMap. Then, you replace the question marks with an inline version of these fields. You should get something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;procedure id=&amp;quot;store_box&amp;quot; parameterClass=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.StoreBoxParameters&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
{call store_box (
#box.height,jdbcType=NUMERIC,mode=IN#,
#box.width,jdbcType=NUMERIC,mode=IN#,
#box.depth,jdbcType=NUMERIC,mode=IN#,
#box.weight,jdbcType=NUMERIC,mode=IN#,
#box.color,jdbcType=VARCHAR,mode=IN#,
#box.origin,jdbcType=VARCHAR,mode=IN#,
#box.destination,jdbcType=VARCHAR,mode=IN#,
#locationCode,jdbcType=VARCHAR,mode=OUT#
)}
&amp;lt;/procedure&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This cleans up your SqlMaps and improves their readability. Note that for OUT parameters to work, the fields you map them to may not be primitives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>StoreBoxParameters
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></description></item><item><title>The rumors can stop now. iPad is here.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/01/27/the-rumors-can-stop-now-ipad-is-here/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2010 20:19:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/01/27/the-rumors-can-stop-now-ipad-is-here/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>So the word is finally out, it's going to be the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/">iPad&lt;/a>. I was kind of worried about this, and my worries are not completely taken away by the news currently oozing out of the Apple keynote. I see some problems with this device, although they are well hidden under Steve's reality distortion field, the Apple secret sauce and the &amp;quot;gee why didn't we think of that&amp;quot; features.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * The dock for the iPad is has me worried about mechanical failure. A large device resting on a small connector.
* Most people I know have a macbook and/or an iPhone. The iPad overlaps both the macbook and the iPhone in functionality, and it requires an extra data subscription. So they will probably hold out for a bit.
* Although the rest of the pad looks beautiful, the &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; button makes it into a big iPhone which I personally think is not a plus.
* The carriers will try to sell you the 3G models, subsidized. Don't go for that, buy the wifi instead, or try to get the wifi+3G sim-lock free. I'm glad Apple did not go for the carrier lock in construction on this one.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I admit, the video looks stunning. The UI is very polished (look at the pinch to peek in a stack of photo's), the device is nice and thin. Notice how the screen does not go all the way to the edge, so that you can put your thumb somewhere to hold it. And although it lacks a camera, it has all other iPhone features (yes, including GPS) so almost all iPhone apps will work on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The additional $130 for the 3G option may be a bit steep, but the overall pricing is pretty good, almost competing with the netbooks, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/pricing/">starting at $499&lt;/a> at the 16GB wifi only model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Judging from the very young information right now, I understand that I may not be target audience for this advice. I need a keyboard and a large screen.Â But if you're in the (American) market for a netbook or something to browse a bit on the couch, have a look atÂ &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/ipad-video/#medium">the video&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Car Buying Story</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/01/10/the-car-buying-story/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2010 22:50:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2010/01/10/the-car-buying-story/</guid><description>

Stephen needs a new car. Being dilligent and a car lover, he takes the time to write down all criteria for a great car. When he finishes the list, he notices that the only car matching all his criteria is a Ferrari. Well, he always loved a Ferrari so that makes sense. To make things more realistic he adds another criteria, called &amp;quot;price&amp;quot;, and starts looking for alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->The first car he looks at is practical, but hasn't got the speed of a Ferrari. The second car can carry a lot of stuff, but hasn't got the sound of a Ferrari. The third car is really modular, but hasn't got the looks of a Ferrari. The fourth car is very fast, but doesn't handle as a Ferrari. The fifth car is an independant brand, and can be repaired in any shop, but it breaks down much more often than a Ferrari. The sixth car has a cool design-flip-type-clock and integrated MP3 player, but the manual coming with it does not explain how to operate them.
&lt;p>The seventh car looked too good to be true good in the advertisement. The images in the brochure look stunning. It has everything on his list, and also matches the price criteria. Stephen orders it immediately. But when delivered it does not live up to the whole Ferrari design, look and feel. By far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stephen is not really unhappy and has learned to live with the car's shortcomings. When asked about his new car, Stephen kindly shows it, but the first sentence he regretfuly utters is &lt;em>&amp;quot;but ofcourse, it's not a Ferrari&amp;quot;...&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The moral of this story is: If you don't buy a Ferrari, you'll never own a Ferrari.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>The RAM mount coming with the Garmin zÅ«mo's are fine, but I wanted something more elegant to go with my Triumph Speed Triple. This article contains a detailed description of building your own mount for the &lt;a href="https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?cID=135&amp;amp;pID=15000">Garmin zÅ«mo 660&lt;/a>. I mounted the zÅ«mo on my Speed Triple, but the mount is universal enough to be center-mounted on any bike which has riser-mounted handlebars.&lt;/p>

* A (stainless steel) brace which can fit the handle bars and the rubber at the thickest part. The standard Garmin mount brace is not long enough, I found a perfectly fitting brace sold as some drywall pipe mount (&lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/5236931">wandputting&lt;/a>).
* two stainless steel self-locking nuts fitting the brace, in my case M6.
* 10x10 aluminum U profile rod, about 50mm length for the counter bracket on the brace
* eight stainless steel M4x15 bolts, with at least four washers.
* 2mm thick aluminum sheet, at least 53x80mm
* at least 30x30mm wood beam, of about 1 meter in length
* wood screwsÂ (trust me on these last two items)
* small bottle of mild threadlock (I used &lt;a href="http://www.loctitesolutions.com/index.php?FOLDERID=12096&amp;amp;PHPSESSID=277a20d2714a013c7235e12cade3653e">loctite 243&lt;/a>)
* some &lt;a href="http://www.wd40.com/">WD40&lt;/a> (you should have that in your shop, next to the &lt;a href="http://www.ducttapeguys.com/">duct tape&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**
Tools you need to have:**&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * sharp (new) 3.2mm HSS drill bit and preferably a bench-press drill
* standard set of steel drill bits (1mm to 10mm, whatever you have handy)
* sharp 15mm wood drill but (this needs to be exact)
* M4 inner thread cutter
* firmly attached [bench vise](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vise)
* a set of [metal files](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(tool))
* a hacksaw
* a wood saw
* a freezer (or rent a small space in that for 24 hours :-)
* an old blanket or towel
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>**
Things you need to do:**&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rubber dampers in the harddisk stabilizer have the wrong hole in one end, and a &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/5237044?album_id=5237009">piece of thread in the other.&lt;/a> To be able to cut new M4 thread, we need to drill through the steel and the rubber. Drilling rubber is usually a problem, but not if we do some careful preparations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8453.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8453.jpg?w=112" alt="">
&lt;/a>Take the 30x30 wood beam, and cut off four pieces of about 7 to 10 cm length. Drill a 15mm hole in each of them. Then, saw it in half with the wood saw. Be carefull to mark the wood pieces, as they need to fit perfectly back together later on. Drill two small holes in one half of the four clamps, so you can screw it back together perfectly, as if it was 1 piece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the rubber dampers from the scythe harddisk stabilizer, put them in the 15mm holes and screw the clamps back together.Â With the hacksaw, saw off the thread coming out of one end of the damper, and file it so that the metal is &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/5237061?album_id=5237009">perfectly flat&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check that the rubber dampers fit the wooden clamps, screw them together pretty tight, and put the four (or eight) assemblies in the freezer for at least 24 hours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To protect the paint on your gastank, put an old blanket or towel on it. This will keep you from scratching the tank in the next steps. Extra advantage is that you can put small nuts and washers on your tank without them rolling away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8483.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8483.jpg?w=150" alt="">
&lt;/a>While waiting for the rubbers to cool off, you can prepare the aluminum parts. Take the 10x10 aluminum frame, and drill two holes in it so that the M6 brace fits through it. Mark the perfect middle between the two holes, and use a half-round steel file to file it down so that it fits the handlebars perfectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Be careful to file perpendicular to the aluminum, and re-check your work often. The U profile sits flush against the handlebars, while being perpendicular to them when looking from the riders position. Don't file too deep, allow for some room between the aluminum plate and the handlebars, so that the &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/5237030?album_id=5237009">screw heads don't touch the bars&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2009-12-29-om-13-54-41.jpg">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2009-12-29-om-13-54-41.jpg?w=248" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, take the aluminum sheet and make it look like the drawing I made here (this is the shortest sentence in this post, resulting in the most work for the reader).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Prepare the benchpress drill by mounting the 3.2mm drill bit. After the rubber dampers in the wood clamps have been in the freezer, take one out and take it to the workshop as fast as you can, make sure to keep it cold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the flat side of the rubber damper (the side where you filed off the thread), drill a hole through the steel, but try not to drill into the rubber too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Flip the clamp over, and drill through the original threaded hole, all the way through the rubber. If your benchpress drill is straight, you &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/5237076?album_id=5237009">should come out through the hole&lt;/a> you just drilled in the in the other steel plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Repeat the whole process for each damper. Minimize the time they are out of the freezer. After you've drilled all dampers, they can warm up again by leaving them in the workshop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8466.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8466.jpg?w=112" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the dampers out of the wooden clamps. You don't need the clamps anymore, give them to a friend so he can make this cool mount, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put one of the rubber dampers in the bench vise and use a small drop of WD40 and the M4 thread cutter to cut thread into the 3.2mm holes. Do this on both sides, make sure that you break the cuttings (one turn forward, then 2/3 back, repeat). Repeat this for all dampers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mount up!
You should now have all pieces to mount. Test the fitting of the mount before you use threadlock (loctite) on any of the parts. Because of the construction, there is an order in which you need to assemble the parts, let me take you through it:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8485.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8485.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Mount the rubbers on the zÅ«mo mount, but do not fasten the screws. Attach the aluminum plate to the other side, also not fastening the screws.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, tighten the screws on the zumo mount first, then tighten the screws on the aluminim plate. This will make sure that the dampers will align perfectly later on. Take one screw out of the aluminum plate, apply threadlock and a washer, and re-tighten it. Repeat for the other three screws in the aluminum plate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you've done all four screws attaching the dampers to the aluminum plate, take the Garmin zÅ«mo mount off. You should now have an aluminum plate with four dampers firmly attached to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8490.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8490.jpg?w=150" alt="">
&lt;/a>Cut the rubber slab to the correct width and length so that it protects your handlebars from scratches by the mount. Use the brace, the aluminum U profile, two washers and two self-locking nuts to attach the aluminum plate to the handlebars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When compfortable with the position, tighten the bolts and &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/5237129?album_id=5237009">attach the zÅ«mo mount&lt;/a> to the rubber dampers, using threadlock. Everything should match up perfectly, don't force anything.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there you have it, all done! More pictures of the whole process are available &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/5237009">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_84991.jpg">&lt;img src="img_84991.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note:&lt;/strong> At the time of writing I did not thouroghly test the durability and strength of this mount and it's dampers. Mounting the zÅ«mo like this is totally at your own risk, so please be careful. If you're not sure about the dampers, buy ready-made ones fit for this purpose. Your GPS supplier should be able to get a hold of a set.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Kilometerheffing? GPS-data NEE!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/12/24/kilometerheffing-gps-data-nee/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Dec 2009 22:51:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/12/24/kilometerheffing-gps-data-nee/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="big-brother-poster.jpg" alt="">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ik weet niet welke lobbyist menner Eurlings heeft verteld dat dit een briljant plan is, maar ik weet donders goed waarom onze regering kilometerheffing wil invoeren. Weer een kraantje toegevoegd aan het vat dat &amp;quot;werkende Nederlander&amp;quot; heet, en als bonus nog wat privacy gevoelige GPS gegevens om in rond te neuzen ook. Mocht je de rest van deze post niet willen lezen, reageer dan wel even op de volgende sites, want Eurlings heeft gezegd dat kilometerheffing &amp;quot;bij gebrek aan draagvlak&amp;quot; (welk draagvlak?) niet doorgaat:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [http://www.redonzeprivacy.nl/](http://www.redonzeprivacy.nl/)
* [http://www.kilometerheffingnoway.nl/](http://www.kilometerheffingnoway.nl/)
* [http://www.kilometerheffing-nee.nl/](http://www.kilometerheffing-nee.nl/)
* [http://petities.nl/petitie/kilometerheffing-is-verkeerd](http://petities.nl/petitie/kilometerheffing-is-verkeerd)
* [http://www.kilometer-heffing.eu/](http://www.kilometer-heffing.eu/)
* ï»¿[http://www.anwbledenpeiling.nl/](http://www.anwbledenpeiling.nl/) &amp;lt;-- Eurlings gaat deze uitslag gebruiken! (als je de vragen gezien hebt zie je waarom :-/ )
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;!-- more -->Voor mij is het duidelijk dat de regering er niet op uit is om het voor de automobilist goedkoper te maken, maar om banen te creeÃ«ren bij de overheid waarvan de salarissen door ons betaald moeten gaan worden. De voor mij vier meest onoverkomelijke bezwaren tegen kilometerheffing zijn:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. **GPS data**
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Voor mij de meest onoverbrugbare hindernis. De regering gaat (ongetwijfeld lelijke) kastjes in onze auto's stoppen, waarbij wij niet weten wat de kastjes gaan registreren, en ook niet weten wat voor data deze kastjes aan de regering gaan geven. Het lijkt me ondertussen duidelijk dat de regering heeft bewezen niet verantwoordelijk om te kunnen gaan met dergelijke gegevens. Denk aan het gemak waarmee de regering maar even denkt te kunnen afluisteren zonder reden. Zo zullen ze ook toegang kunnen krijgen tot onze GPS data, zonder dat wij dit weten. Ook al wordt autorijden de helft goedkoper, dan nog ben ik tegen, om precies deze reden. Geen politiestaat a.u.b.
2. &lt;strong>Onkontroleerbaare verhogingen&lt;/strong>
De regering zal de kilometerprijs zonder onderbouwing kunnen verhogen, doordat deze prijs niet is gekoppeld aan olieprijzen, of werkelijke onderhoudskosten aan de weg. &amp;quot;We komen niet uit&amp;quot; of &amp;quot;het is hier te druk&amp;quot; en de prijs gaat omhoog. Waar nu de belasting nog gekoppeld is aan aanschafprijs en benzinetarief, kan de regering straks met de &amp;quot;psychische barriere&amp;quot; breken en de rekening ongelimiteerd verhogen.
3. &lt;strong>Implementatiekosten&lt;/strong>
Om iedere auto in Nederland van een kastje te voorzien dat, schat ik, minimaal zo'n slordige 40 euro kost, zal een ongeloofelijke investering vragen (7 mln auto's x â¬40 = â¬280 mln exclusief versturen en inbouwen), die uiteraard voor rekening van de belastingbetaler (automobilist) komen.
4. &lt;strong>Lopende kosten&lt;/strong>
Na invoering van het systeem moet er een heel administratie apparaat worden ingericht om de data van al die kastjes te verzamelen, rekeningen te sturen, kapotte kastjes te vervangen, en oude kastjes in te vorderen. Daarbij komt er bij de politie waarschijnlijk een last te liggen op kastjes controle, of ze wel in de auto zitten.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wat de regering donders goed begrijpt, ook al zeggen ze dat niet, is dat Nederlanders de auto niet uit gaan, al zouden ze dat willen. De sneeuw van afgelopen periode heeft weer bewezen dat als de nood aan de man is, de auto verreweg het meest betrouwbare vervoersmiddel is. Van de trein hoeven we dat niet te verwachten, en over de bus hoef ik niet eens te beginnen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Werkende mensen die op tijd op hun werk moeten zijn hebben vaak geen andere keuze dan met de auto naar het werk te gaan. Ze kunnen ook niet kiezen waar hun baas een kantoor neerzet. De meeste bedrijven vestigen zich in een drukke stad, om allerlei redenen. Geen van die redenen is bereikbaarheid voor de medewerker, dat is namelijk niet het probleem van de werkgever. Als de regering bedrijven zou belasten voor de file die ze veroorzaken zouden de zaken er anders voor staan. Maar dat doet de regering niet, want dan is het fileprobleem opgelost, en dat is financieel niet aantrekkelijk omdat er dan geen spits-kilometerheffing geheven kan worden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Daarbij komt nog dat de regering &amp;quot;per ongeluk&amp;quot; hybride auto's heeft gestimuleerd, als publiciteitsstunt naar andere landen toe. De stap naar 100% electrische auto's komt dan snel in het zicht, en dan kan de regering opeens geen belasting meer heffen op brandstof. Dus vandaar dat de voordelen voor hybride rijders worden teruggedraaid, en er een manier wordt geintroduceerd zodat ook electrisch rijden kan worden gemolken ehhh, ik bedoel natuurlijk &amp;quot;financieel gestuurd&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Inmiddels is er door veel mensen aangetoond dat Eurlings loopt te liegen als hij zegt dat het zeker niet duurder gaat worden. Daarbij spreekt hij zichzelf tegen, want &amp;quot;als het in de randstad duurder wordt, gaat het gemiddelde omlaag&amp;quot;. Da's grappig, de meeste file's staan in de randstad, dus voor de meeste mensen zal het duurder worden he. Bovendien staan die mensen daar niet voor de lol in de file, meneer Eurlings...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Het mooiste voorbeeld was nog wel de kilometerheffing voor motoren. Als iedereen op een motor zou komen, zouden er geen files meer staan, en zou het asfalt langer meegaan omdat het minder zwaar belast wordt. Hoe kan het dan dat de regering van plan is om motoren ook kilometerheffing te laten betalen? Gelukkig heeft de &lt;a href="http://www.knmv.nl/knmv/nieuws/motorrijders-uitgesloten-van-km-heffing">KNMV&lt;/a> hier een stokje voor gestoken maar het is duidelijk dat de regering op weg is naar een communistische politiestaat, en dat we dit allemaal blijkbaar gewoon laten gebeuren.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ondertussen snoept de regering bij invoering van deze regeling ook nog geld weg bij provincie en gemeenten, en die zijn nu al hun &amp;quot;opcenten&amp;quot; aan het verhogen. Die neemt Eurlings niet mee, dus als hij zegt &amp;quot;goedkoper&amp;quot; dan haalt hij een rekentruck uit die niet alle gevolgen meeneemt voor uw gezinssituatie.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Voorspelling:&lt;/strong> Bij het invoeren van de kilometerheffing zal de accijns op de brandstof niet verdwijnen. (Kwartje van Kok, weten we het nog?). Lasten zullen niet verlagen, en het regeringsapparaat zal mensen moeten aannemen om dit alles te runnen, waardoor kosten hoger zullen uitkomen dan voorspeld.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Je eigen kilometerprijs berekenen? Dat kan op een aantal sites, zoals bij de &lt;a href="http://www.anwb.nl/kilometerprijscheck/berekenuwkilometerprijs/kilometerprijscheck">ANWB&lt;/a>, maar aangezien die niet &amp;quot;tegen&amp;quot; zijn zou ik de berekening met een korrel zout nemen, het kan wel eens veeeeel duurder worden dan je nu voorgehouden wordt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slaap zacht.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flow</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/12/22/flow/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2009 21:34:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/12/22/flow/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="left-right.jpg">&lt;img src="left-right.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Being &amp;quot;in the flow&amp;quot;. The nicest state of mind known to mankind. You act without thinking, and everyone of your actions is the perfect response to the situation. Riding a motorcycle on a beautiful road without a destination can easily get you into this state. With an empty mind, you see the next 2 corners, feel your bike as your brakes hit the disc, smell the forest, and hear the wind as you start accelerating out of the first corner while naturally placing the bike into position for the next.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Software developers also know "flow", and mentally it does not differ that much from riding a motorcycle. Coders call this "being in the zone". It's you, the code, and the next 2 unittests. You effortlesly write the perfect conditions for your loop, while noticing the log of the buildserver, and thinking about the solution you already have for the next problem.
&lt;p>In order to get into the flow, conditions need to be perfect. You have to be in the right mood. There should be no distractions. There needs to be rythm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Coding and biking is done by &amp;quot;enjoy the ride&amp;quot; people. They enjoy the thrill of that perfect corner, or that perfect try/catch block, without worrying to much about the destination. Destination is usually the worry of the &amp;quot;a-to-b&amp;quot; people. These are to people that need to get to their destination. Usually car drivers, they will talk about destinations, the bluetooth and stereo in their cars, but rarely enjoy the ride itself. When they get to &amp;quot;B&amp;quot;, a new destination is chosen and the race is on again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;A-to-b&amp;quot; people often don't understand &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;being in the zone&amp;quot;. They also don't understand that it's hard to get &amp;quot;in the flow&amp;quot; and very easy to get out. Changing the end goal of a long project is not all that troublesome. But changing the next 2 corners will get your &amp;quot;enjoy the ride&amp;quot; team members out of the flow for sure. Do it too often, and your team will not even try to get into the flow, because there is nothing more frustrating than being yanked out of your flow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Programming seems dull and nerdy. But being &amp;quot;in the zone&amp;quot; or having &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; can give you quite a rush, with some similarities to riding a bike on a sunny, twisty mountain road.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sonar "Close Connection" warning workaround.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/10/06/sonar-close-connection-warning-workdaround/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2009 08:38:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/10/06/sonar-close-connection-warning-workdaround/</guid><description>
&lt;p>When you use Spring and Ibatis and SQLTemplates, you could have code in your project which looks somewhat like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Connection connection = DataSourceUtils.getConnection(getDataSource());
...&amp;lt;do connection stuff here&amp;gt;...
DataSourceUtils.releaseConnection(connection, getDataSource());
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Sonar will report that you did not close the connection, while in fact, Spring did that for you. You can not just add a &lt;em>&amp;quot;connection.close()&amp;quot;&lt;/em> to the code because the whole point of calling &lt;em>&amp;quot;releaseConnection()&amp;quot;&lt;/em> is to have Spring handle all the smart stuff on committing, closing, and returning the connection to the pool if needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->In our company, not closing the connection is a major blocking violation (and it should be). But in this case, there is no way to make the Jedi wave to Sonar, telling it that "this code will do just fine". So I added the following trick, albeit a bit dirty:
&lt;pre>&lt;code>if (connection.isClosed()){
// This code is only here to keep Sonar from
// warning us that the connection is not
// closed. Please note: Do not just close an
// unclosed connection, Spring should handle
// connection closing and returning to the pool.
connection.close();
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Use it to your advantage, but use this responsibly. If you see any problems in my solution, or if there is a better way to do this I'd be happy to hear about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit (2009-12-01):&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is a much better way to do this if you have Spring/Ibatis integration. In stead of DataSourceUtils.getConnection() you can create a new ConnectionCallback object, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>JdbcTemplate template = new JdbcTemplate(getDataSource());
Object resultObject = template.execute(new ConnectionCallback() {
public Object doInConnection(Connection conn)Â 
throws SQLException, DataAccessException {
// Do connection stuff here (can return object);
return null;
});
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that this code does NOT contain any Connection.close() references. The connection is passed to you, you can use it, and after your method completes, the framework will do whatever is needed to clean everything up. Sonar will not complain because the whole open/close handeling is done outside your method.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bill Gates works at Apple</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/09/13/bill-gates-works-at-apple/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2009 23:00:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/09/13/bill-gates-works-at-apple/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-6.jpg">&lt;img src="afbeelding-6.jpg?w=150" alt="Steve Jobs">
&lt;/a>I was happy to see Steve return on the Apple keynote of 9 September, because boy does Apple need somebody with clear vision. The introductions on the new iPod line are all over the place. Let me tell you why I think Steve has not been running the operation for the past few months:&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * **Ringtones.** The price of a ringtone in the iTunes store is (still) higher than that of a song. You can make a ring tone out of a song [for free](http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks) already, so why put the effort into selling ringtones at a way too high price? The phone companies must have influenced some &amp;quot;less sturdy&amp;quot; people at Apple for this.
* **The Nano Camera.** 2 mistakes on this one. First is the device. Why put a camera on the Nano of all iPods? Wouldn't we expect that on the iPod touch? Or perhaps both? Second is the location. Anybody holding a nano must notice that the camera is in a place where your hand is when holding the nano. Maybe it makes a bit more sense in landscape mode, right after you smudged it with your hand. Maybe I'd have to hold one for good testing. I heard that the camera is not nearly as good as the one on the iPhone 3Gs.
* **iTunes 9's Column Browser.** When I installed iTunes 9, my trusty 3-pane music browser was gone. I had a list of artists on the left, and next to that all my music as a long list of unsorted tracks. Gee thanks. After some fiddling I got the 3-paned browser back (see my [earlier blogpost](http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/itunes-9-genre-artist-album-panes-restored/)) but the fiddling in the menus got me that &amp;quot;Windows&amp;quot; feeling of tweaking a crappy UI into something I can sort of use.
* **Genius Mixes.** After seeing the keynote, I was eager to try out the &amp;quot;Genius Mixes&amp;quot; feature. In the keynote, these mixes are available under the Genius item on the left. When I looked, there was nothing there. I searched preferences and menus to turn them on, but found nothing. It turns out that you need to upload Genius data to Apple before the Genius Mixes appear. The mixes themselves are working fine, but when a Genius Mix is playing, you can do nothing. No coverflow. No Track details. I can not even rate the currently playing song. This cripples it's potential of finding and rating great songs in a large library.
* **Syncing knobs and levers.** Where syncing used to be simple, it is now 9 tabs with a slew of boxes and sliders you can drag suff between. I know a lot of customers asked for it, but that has never stopped Apple coming up with a totally brilliant solution to a problem, instead of just implementing the user's crappy first thought. I will get used to it, and it will probably work fine, but it just adds to a scary feeling I had of an Apple without Steve.
* **Twitter integration.** Come on Apple, you are not serious now, are you? There are hundreds of Twitter and IM integration apps that will do something like this. Apple did not even add that &amp;quot;innovative cool juice&amp;quot; to it. They just messed up iTunes codebase with this quick hack, making it even harder to port iTunes to 64 bit Cocoa.
* &amp;quot;**Richer&amp;quot; LP content.** I hate the iTunes appstore pages where developers are using way more CSS and markup than you would like to. It's like the walls of the grocery store change each time you look at a different product. It's confusing and ugly. Now, with the LP stuff added, Apple now is going one step further, and starts selling this for a price. Just like the ringtones.
* **Incoherent iPod touch line.** The 8GB iPod touch is sold at $199, which is great, but it was not &amp;quot;revved&amp;quot;, meaning that the 16+GB iPod touches have a different chipset. How do you explain the customer that a game is running slower on one touch, and faster on the other? Sure it's done to get to the $199 price point, but Apple didn't work like this in the old days. They used to introduce a new (revved) model at the same pricepoint.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The whole talk feels a bit &amp;quot;all over the place&amp;quot;, and a way of charging customers for something they do not really need. I know, usually keynotes get the &amp;quot;woos&amp;quot; from the cround every 15 seconds and it's hard to do that time and time again. And Steve just returned, having to sell the stuff he may not have wanted to put out there in the first place. So I'll forgive them this time. But this fan boy will be watching Apple and hope it will be a bit more consistent next time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-4.jpg">&lt;img src="afbeelding-4.jpg" alt="Jeff? Or Bill?">

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.ahajokes.com/cartoon/bagjoke.jpg">&lt;img src="safety_goggles.gif" alt="Safety googles">
&lt;/a>At work, we have two applications which connect to the same database. For all kinds of business reasons, we need to make sure that only one of the applications accesses certain data at the same time. To do this, we use a row in a table as a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">semaphore&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While working on the locking mechanism, we had a closer look at the Transaction Management and the Isolation Levels we were using. There is a lot of good documentation on Transaction and Isolation, but it tends to be over complete, elaborate and therefore hard to read. I'll try to share our insights with you in a slightly more digestable form (I hope).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->What is a Transaction&lt;/strong>
Every (proper) database uses Transactions. A Transaction is a unit of work which you can undo (roll back) or save (commit) to the database. Generally, database clients tend to &amp;quot;Auto Commit&amp;quot; which effectively means that each of your actions on the database are executed immediately and can not be rolled back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you click through your client's settings, you can probably find an option to turn Auto Commit off. Now, at your first database write action (insert or update), a Transaction is started. The database will keep track of each of your write actions, and once you're finished, you can decide to keep the changes by &amp;quot;committing&amp;quot; the Transaction. You can also decide to revert all the changes you made and do a &amp;quot;rollback&amp;quot;, as long as the Transaction is not closed.Â Both Commit and Rollback close a transaction, so choose wisely.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What is an Isolation Level&lt;/strong>
Most databases allow more than one user to connect to the database. In order for you to do your work, you may require a stable database without changes. To protect yourself from seeing other peoples updates, you can set an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(database_systems)">&amp;quot;Isolation Level&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. Generally, you set the isolation level at the time of starting a Transaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Isolation levels come in many different flavours, from &amp;quot;liberal&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;strict&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * _READ UNCOMMITTED_ - Allows you to see the database as it is right now. Doing he same query on a table twice is likely to produce different results as other people are updating the table, even if they haven't committed their transactions yet.
* _READ COMMITTED_ - The database will only show you changes to the table which are commited. Doing the same query twice can still produce different results, but you're sure that those changes will not be olled back by the authors.
* _REPEATABLE READ_ - The database will make sure that when you execute the same query twice, you will see the same data twice. It may have to lock the rows in the table to do this, which will prevent other people from updating them until you complete your transaction.
* _SERIALIZABLE_ - The database will not only make sure you see the same data, but it will also make sure that all updates in the system are done in such a way that it seems as if there was only 1 user connected to the database at a time. This is the most &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; isolation level, and tends to be relatively slow.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Transaction is not Isolation.&lt;/strong>
Although a Transaction may suggest that your changes are not written to the database until after your commit, it will write all changes directly to the tables. That means that anybody can see what you are doing to the database, depending on their Isolation levels. Mind you: &lt;em>their&lt;/em> isolation levels, not yours.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see a Transaction as your &amp;quot;undo buffer&amp;quot; if you will, and the &amp;quot;Isolation Level&amp;quot; as the filter through which you are looking at other people's actions to the database.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How about our semaphores?&lt;/strong>
Back to our semaphore problem. Reading about Transactions and Isolation Levels, we knew that both systems must do the &amp;quot;fetch&amp;quot; (a read and an update) of the semaphore within a single transaction, and both systems must use the &amp;quot;serializable&amp;quot; isolation level to make sure that it reads the correct, current value without having a chance of incorrectly fetching the smaphore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What's funny about the serializable isolation level however, is that it does not prevent you from overwriting other people's values without knowing. Our example:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Application 1 reads the semaphore to be 0 and decides it can set it to 1.
2. Application 2 reads the semaphore to be 0 and also decides it can set it to 1.
3. Application 1 sets the semaphore to 1 and thinks it has the lock.
4. Application 2 also sets the semaphore to 1 and thinks is has the lock.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This is clearly a problem. We learned that:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Regardless of your isolation level or transaction usage, the last commit always wins.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is, however one database on the market which at least fails in this situation. It's Oracle. When you use the &amp;quot;Serializable&amp;quot; isolation level, Oracle will prevent you from overwriting a row which was changed without your knowing about it. This changes our scenario as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Application 1 reads the semaphore to be 0 and decides it can set it to 1.
2. ApplicationÂ 2 reads the semaphore to be 0 and also decides it can set it to 1.
3. ApplicationÂ 1 sets the semaphore to 1 and thinks it has the lock.
4. ApplicationÂ 2 tries to set the semaphore to 1, but Oracle notices that the row has changed since the last read, and will fail to do the update. An error (ORA-08177)Â is thrown at the application, allowing you to re-read the lock and discover it has been taken.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>
Generally, you will have 1 application connecting to 1 database. The application will use the same Transaction granularity and Isolation levels throughout, and you will not notive these interesting behaviours. As soon as you have multiple applications with different isolation levels connecting to the same databases, you are likely to run into interesting, sporadic irreproducable problems. Try to think about your Isolation strategies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If I got you interested, I recommend reading &lt;a href="http://blog.xebia.com/2007/11/28/oracle-and-ora-08177/">this blogpost by Peter Veentjer&lt;/a> about this very same thing.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/">&lt;img src="opicon.jpg" alt="Omniplan">
&lt;/a>During one of my Omniplan sessions at work, I discovered that the resource leveling was acting a bit funny, where people were not planned to do any work for days. I played around with a fake planning and soon discovered the problem and several solutions to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Imagine you have a 1-man project, with a couple of tasks. You want to keep track of the planning in Omniplan. So you set up a project as follows (sorry for the spelling error, discoverd it after taking all the screenshots):
&lt;p>&lt;a href="planning-constrained.png">&lt;img src="planning-constrained.png" alt="(over)constrained planning">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything looks fine and you set out to do your job. While putting the dishes on the sink, you decide to run hot water into the sink and place the dishes directly in the water. That will gain you some time. To reflect that, you slide the progress bar of &amp;quot;wash dishes&amp;quot;. Now your planning looks as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="planning-constrained-progress.png">&lt;img src="planning-constrained-progress.png" alt="(over)constrained planning with progress">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first sight that might not look so strange. But when you look into your resource availability, you see that you are not 100% assigned to the project:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="resources-gap.png">&lt;img src="resources-gap.png" alt="Gap in resources due to completion">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did this happen? Well, Omniplan says (or rather: you toold Omniplan) that the &amp;quot;wash dishes&amp;quot; task can only start after the &amp;quot;Put dishes on Sink&amp;quot; task was finished. It will hold you to that, wether or not you reported progress on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution 1&lt;/strong>
The first solution is also a golden rule. Only put constraints in your planning if you are absolutely 100% positive that they need to be there. Removing the constraints from this planning (because you can start washing before everything is in the sync) will result in correct progress and an earlier finish, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="planning-unconstrained.png">&lt;img src="planning-unconstrained.png" alt="unconstrained planning progress">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And you will notice that the resource occupation is now also back at 100%:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="resources-level.png">&lt;img src="resources-level.png" alt="100% filled, leveled resources (yay!)">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution 2&lt;/strong>
A collegue of mine has another phylosophy: only have work on your planning that you are going to do in the future. Completed tasks are removed, and existing tasks are shortened as you work on them. Don't use the progress sliders, and measure gain or loss against the baseline planning. This is what I used to do with MSProject until now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution 3&lt;/strong>
Buy a dishwasher.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why you want a Polarizer Filter</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/06/16/why-you-want-a-polarizer-filter/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jun 2009 23:00:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/06/16/why-you-want-a-polarizer-filter/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I recently bought a 50mm lens with a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photographic_filter#Polarizer">circular polarizer&lt;/a>. I though I'd share some quick examples to show what a polarizer filter does for your photo's.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The polarization effect is probably one of the few (if not only) effect which you can not reproduce in photoshop or any other image processing program. Most applications try by increasing saturation, which is nowhere near the effect of a real polarizer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By rotating the filter, you have the luxury of choosing how much effect you want to have, anywhere between 0% and 100%. The shots below give you an idea what the range of the effect is:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_965&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;Left Minimal polarizer effect. Right: Maximal polarizer effect&amp;quot;]&lt;a href="cluds-polarizer.png">&lt;img src="cluds-polarizer.png?w=300" alt="Left Minimal polarizer effect. Right: Maximal polarizer effect">
&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Landscape photographers never leave home without a polarizer. It will render better detail in the clouds, and give better overal colour saturation. When there is a lot of reflection in water, the polarizer should be used with caution. Removing all reflection in favour of a beautiful sky can result in an unrealistic feeling in the shot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_966&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;aligncenter&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;300&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;Left Minimal polarizer effect. Right: Maximal polarizer effect&amp;quot;]&lt;a href="leafs-polarizer.png">&lt;img src="leafs-polarizer.png?w=300" alt="Left Minimal polarizer effect. Right: Maximal polarizer effect">
&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A little less obvious, but a great tip to give your portrait shots an extra edge: When you shoot portraits of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marinshe/1130799762/in/set-72157594224391770/">people against foliage&lt;/a>, use your polarizer to get the highlights out of the foliage. This will make sure the viewer is not distracted from the subject. As bonus, the skin tone of your model will be slightly warmer, making your model look &amp;quot;healthier&amp;quot; :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse with portraits you don't want to &amp;quot;overdo&amp;quot; it. It's easu to over-saturate the photo, and the polarizer will &amp;quot;eat&amp;quot; one to two stops of light, which will make it harder to keep everything crispy sharp. I think I'd go for the (much cheaper) &amp;quot;magic hour&amp;quot; and a little fill-flash instead of a polarizer, but sometimes there is no choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The polarizer I used here is a 58mm circular polarizer from Tiffen, which you can find for just above â¬40,- new, which is quite a bargain. If your glass has a larger mount, the filters can get pretty expensive (â¬150 and up), probably because it is harder to get an even polarization effect over a larger piece of glass with light coming in from a wider angle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A polarizer filter needs to be rotated to get the right effect, so it's nice if the front element of your lens does not rotate during focussing. In the case of the Canon 50mm lenses (th f1.2, the f1.4, and the f1.8), the front element will not rotate. The f1.2 will even not extend during focussing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other dramatic examples of shots using polarizers are &lt;a href="http://shutterbug.com/equipmentreviews/accessories/0109hoya/">here&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.travel-to-crete.com/gallery_images/395.jpg">here&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y51/Rayfromalaska/fall8.jpg">here&lt;/a>,Â and &lt;a href="http://www.photographyiseasy.com/blg/273/polarizing-filters--do-you-need-one.html">here&lt;/a>. A nice combo-filter comparison is &lt;a href="http://www.pbase.com/jpeper/image/32267513/original.jpg">here&lt;/a>. (Links to external sites, get them while they last!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Linear Polarier
A linear polarizer is a single piece of glass which only passes light which is polarized in 1 direction. Reflected light normally tends to polarize parpendicular to the surface it reflected from. So a lake will produce horizontally polarized light, and a window vertically polarized light. You can choose to filter this out bu rotating your linear polarizer.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Circular Polarizer
**Some camera's make use of partial reflection in their metering or focussing systems. Since reflection means polerization, you can get into trouble if there is a linear polarizer in front of your camera. In some orientations, light will not be able to be reflected into the metering system, which renders it useless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To circumvent this problem, we need to convert the linear polarized light into circular polarized light (hence the name circular polarizer). This is done by adding an extra piece of glass behind the linear polarizer. This extra piece of glass is called a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_plate">&amp;quot;Quarter Wave Plate&amp;quot;&lt;/a> which turns linear polarized light into circular polarized light. This allows your metering system to reflect it as if it were normal light coming into the lens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Quarter Wave Plate is expensive to make, and it needs to be neatly glued to the linear polarizer in front of it. That's why circular polarizers are generally more expensive. It is also why linear polarizers are observed to be &amp;quot;more effective&amp;quot;, because it's simply a thicker polarizer. The Circular Polarizer needs to have 2 pieces of glass in the same space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So to sum it up: Linear Polarizer is a single sheet of glass, while a Circular Polarizer is a Linear Polarizer with a Quarter Wave Plate glued to it (Over-simplified ofcourse). The only reason to buy a circular polarizer is because your metering system requires it. This is the case in most DSLRs, but not in many point and shoots.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Starting Java app from Applescript</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/06/11/starting-java-app-from-applescript/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2009 20:36:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/06/11/starting-java-app-from-applescript/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Now that the twitter hype is cooling down, and companies tart to realize that it is, in fact, just CB radio in a new asynchronous form, only the &amp;quot;true tweeps&amp;quot; still hang around. And now, it's time to t(w)inker with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>[caption id=&amp;quot;attachment_942&amp;quot; align=&amp;quot;alignright&amp;quot; width=&amp;quot;150&amp;quot; caption=&amp;quot;Early 2002, in my dad's old &amp;quot;shack&amp;quot;, we measured the accuracy of a delayed solonoid triggering device I made.&amp;quot;]&lt;a href="02020905.jpg">&lt;img src="02020905.jpg?w=150" alt="Early 2002, in my dad's old "shack", we measured the accuracy of a delayed solonoid triggering device I made.">
&lt;/a>[/caption]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some years ago, I did some playing around with CB radio. With my dad being an electronics engineer and a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_radio">HAM radio&lt;/a> operator, it didn't take long before I got my HAM radio license, and start taking apart and putting together all kinds of electronics to play with this medium. We had quite some fun doing this, and I got a lot of great stories out of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the coming of Twitter as the &amp;quot;new CB radio&amp;quot;, a new kind of tinkering came along. Not so much with electronics, but more with the data of twitter itself. Here are some of the funny and/or interesting services I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>WARNING:&lt;/strong> Some of these services show you a very &amp;quot;Twitter like&amp;quot; login form, and ask you to sign in with your Twitter userid and password. Please think very careful about this. Giving somebody your twitter password can render your account useless, and exposes you to possible forms of identity theft. Except for twitpic, none of these services have ever seen my password.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://twitoaster.com/rolfje">Twitoaster&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
One of the problems with Twitter is that you don't always see your conversations. People might only see one half of it, or because of it's asynchronous character, miss essential tweets in a conversation. To solve this, Twitoaster searches your tweets, finds replies, and groups them together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The downside is that you need to follow @twitoaster, which can ruin your &amp;quot;tweet stream&amp;quot;. Having said that, there are not much tweets coming from that account so maybe it won't bother you that much. Although twitoaster.com shows you a login form, you are not required to log in for this service to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://xefer.com/twitter/rolfje">Xefer&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
If you like cool pictures made from your tweeting habbits, Xefer can do that for you. It will display an activity graph which shows you which days of the week and which hours of those days you are most active on Twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://twitterank.com/?u=rolfje">Twitterank&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
Some mysterious algorithm places people in a list in a certain order, and calls it a &amp;quot;rank&amp;quot;. Now all of a sudden, people want to be on top. Isn't that funny? The developer of this site had hacked some stuff together, and was soon overwhelmed by people wanting to know their &amp;quot;rank&amp;quot;. This is ofcourse just as silly as measuring your success by the number of followers you have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time of this writing, my twitterrank is 14.26. According to twitterank, this score is higher than 37.68 of the other ranked twitterers. Not knowing what the algorithm is, and not knowing how to influence it, means this number is totally useless and silly. But hey, we like numbers... Yay twitterank!&lt;/p>

One of my favourites, displays your usage info in nice simple colorful layout. While you are waiting, funny texts as &amp;quot;magic happening&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;there be feries&amp;quot; are shown on the progess bar.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>Always fun to read and always changing (if you keep tweeting), this service reads all your tweets and takes a shot at estimating your personality from their contents. At the time of this writing, it thinks of me as &amp;quot;likeable sociable fair&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;garrulous coherent&amp;quot;. It sums it up as &amp;quot;Poet&amp;quot;. Ahem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I you're not tweeting enough, or there is something else this service thinks is wrong, it will give you some tweeting tips. Very funny. Don't forget to check out the &lt;a href="http://twanalyst.com/rolfje/suggest">&amp;quot;suggest&amp;quot;&lt;/a> feature, which will try to find people with a similar writing style youmight like following.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://hashtags.org/">Hashtags&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
Tracks hashtags in the global timeline. With this service you can see people's tweets grouped by tags. Very handy if you want to keep up with a particular subject. I personally use it to check &lt;a href="http://hashtags.org/tag/followfriday/messages">followfriday&lt;/a> tags every now and then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://twitterposter.com/nl">Twitterposter&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>
Shows you a cloud of twitter icons. The bigger the icon, the more followers this account has. The bad news is that it sometimes does not load all icons or avatars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Final thoughts&lt;/strong>
There are many, many, many more twitter services out there, but you want to be careful with sharing your password. For example, &lt;em>Tweetmondo.com&lt;/em> needs your twitter account password, just to tell you if there are &amp;quot;tweeps&amp;quot; close to your location? No thank you, Tweetie on my iPhone already does that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same goes for &lt;em>Localtweeps.com&lt;/em>, which tries to match you and other local tweeps through your ZIP code. I never was even tempted to give them my password, because it's developers seem to think that the world only consists of US, Canada and UK. Nothing to see here, move along...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have a twitter account which has enough data to make these services work, you are one of the luck few. An &lt;a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/blogs/patterson/50591/study-top-10-of-twitter-users-do-90-of-the-tweeting/">article on tech.yahoo.com&lt;/a> shows that the top 10% of twitter users do 90% of the twittering. I hope they didn't count those dumb automated tweets, because there are a lot of those...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's funny how companies still seem to think that they can just &amp;quot;connect to a network&amp;quot;, send us spam, and them expect we'll like them. These companies are either loaded, or doomed, because in a few months, they might have to connect to a different network. Like Scoble said: &lt;em>&amp;quot;Networks don't have people. People have networks.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrate from Password Gorilla to KeePass</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/05/12/migrate-from-password-gorilla-to-keepass/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 May 2009 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/05/12/migrate-from-password-gorilla-to-keepass/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://keepass.info/">&lt;img src="keepass.png" alt="KeePass logo">
&lt;/a>I used to use &lt;a href="http://fpx.de/fp/Software/Gorilla/">Password Gorilla&lt;/a> to store my passwords, because it can run on both Mac and Windows. Because my password database keeps growing, Password Gorilla is becomming a very slow starter, even on my new solid state disk. A few weeks ago I learned that KeePass is a much more modern application, and is available for both Mac and Windows. Here's what I did to get all my passwords into KeePass:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Download [KeePass 1.05](http://sourceforge.net/project/downloading.php?group_id=95013&amp;amp;filename=KeePass-1.05.zip&amp;amp;a=41072444) (this is an older version, but required by the following plugin)
2. Download the [PwSafeDbImport ](http://keepass.info/plugins.html#pwsafedbimport)plugin.
3. Unzip both zipfiles.
4. Put the PwSafeDbImport.dll file in the directory where KeePass.exe is.
5. Start KeePass.exe
6. Click on &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Plugins&amp;quot; and right-click on the PwSafeDbImport plugin, select &amp;quot;enable&amp;quot;
7. Stop KeePass, and start it again.
8. Create a new KeePass password file (Ctrl-N)
9. Select &amp;quot;File&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Import from&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;PwSafe database&amp;quot;
10. Select the Password Gorilla database you want to import from
11. Enter your Password Gorilla database password
12. Check (some of) the new entries in KeePass to verify the import went smoothly
13. Save the KeePass file.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now that you're done, you can upgrade to the &lt;a href="http://keepass.info/download.html">latest KeePass version&lt;/a>. The KeePass database stays compatible between versions, information on that is on the KeePass website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Shooting 16:9 with a 4:3 Camera</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/05/03/shooting-169-with-a-43-camera/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 May 2009 10:03:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/05/03/shooting-169-with-a-43-camera/</guid><description>
&lt;p>If you have a Canon Ixus 80IS, like me, and you shoot video for your widescreen television at home (like me), you may want to try out this little trick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Canon Ixus is a 4:3 camera. The video that comes out of it is almost square shaped. When you try to make a 16:9 video, you can stretch it, or crop it. Cropping is far better, but you need some &amp;quot;headroom&amp;quot; to do that. If you made a closeup, chances are that you do not have enough room to crop to a 16:9 format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="aspect-ratios.jpg">&lt;img src="aspect-ratios.jpg?w=150" alt="aspect-ratios">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I solved this by making this little chart, which I placed on a memorycard and put in my camera. By previewing the image on the camera's display, you know where the &amp;quot;16:9 limit&amp;quot; is. I put two pieces of half-translucent tape on the camera, so I can tell what fit's inside the 16:9 frame. I also included the other formats, like 3:2, and 2.39:1, should you want to make wide-screen theater movies :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, I load up the movie in iMovie, and it will be cropped perfectly. Suppose you missed the 16:9 frame or want to re-center your shot, you can always press the &amp;quot;crop&amp;quot; button in your project to tell iMovie which piece of the image you want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Packing bags on a Speed Triple</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/04/18/packing-bags-on-a-speed-triple/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2009 13:53:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/04/18/packing-bags-on-a-speed-triple/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_1798.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1798.jpg" alt="my Triumph Speed Triple">
&lt;/a>As you may know, I traded in my Honda Sevenfifty for a nice Triumph Speed Triple. While waiting for the bike to be delivered, I tried to fiend out how I can take my hefty 4-star ART chainlock on this bike. Apparently, nobody uses chainlocks on their bikes because I could find no information at all about transporting chainlocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Ofcourse you can put the chainlock around your body, or in a backpack, but neither of these solutions are without risk. Particularly wearing a chainlock around your neck is pretty dangerous when you fall. You might expect that bike manufacturers would leave some room under the seat to transport a lock. But if you have a Speed Triple, you know how little room there is under the seat.
&lt;p>Â 
&lt;a href="img_1932.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1932.jpg?w=200" alt="Speed Triple storage... None.">
&lt;/a>Â Â  Â &lt;a href="img_1934.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1934.jpg?w=200" alt="No room in the seat itself... But look! Loops!">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see in these pictures, there is not even enough room to put a pair of summer gloves or a simple disclock under the seat. There is a small compartment at the rear, but my insurance requires me to have an SCM approved alarm, which takes up the remaining space under the seat (the box with the yellow sticker in the top left picture).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_1945.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1945.jpg" alt="Loops sticking out">
&lt;/a>Â Â  Â &lt;a href="img_1942.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1942.jpg" alt="img_1942">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To my surprise, Triumph did add a cool feature to the seat itself: loops! Lift the seat, fold the loops out, and put the seat back. Now you can put a backpack on your buddyseat, and strap it to the bike without damaging or even touching any painted parts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design Gripes</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/04/08/design-gripes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Apr 2009 21:46:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/04/08/design-gripes/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Dear Akio Morita,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/sony_releases_new_stupid_piece_of">&lt;img src="2009-04-08-234308.png" alt="Onion News Network on Sony products">
&lt;/a>Lately I have some small issues with a lot of design decisions being made by the company you founded a while ago. If you look at my irritations seperately they're just small gripes of a grumpy old customer. But the increasing number of design mistakes have me worried about your user acceptance testing and quality assurance processes. Given the sheer size of your company, and the fact that the very same people who are sabotaging your overall product quality can silently delete my complaint, I thought I'd share it with you here, on my very private blog.Â  Nobody else will read this. Honest.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Let me start by saying that I love my Playstation 3. No wait, let me rephrase that. I love playing games on my playstation 3. Because the playstation 3 itself is absolutely not intuitive, logical or even pleasant to use. Both hardware and software wise.
&lt;p>I am very fortunate to have a loving wife who bought a PS3 for me. Because she did not expect to have to do in-depth research about the differences between the models, she bought the 80GB PS3 for me. It was the biggest drive in the store, so she thought that was the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was/am really happy with the very nice present. Not having any PS3 games yet, I slapped in a PS2 game, fully expecting that it would play. Not so. As it turns out, only the 60GB model plays &lt;em>some&lt;/em> of the PS2 games, and most of the time not even perfectly. What's with that? Can this 3-Cell processor huge 80GB machine with metric craploads of memory not emulate the outdated PS2? Did nobody at Sony realize that they can capitalize on people upgrading from the PS2? Not even now that the &lt;a href="http://ps3finder.com/">60GB models actually sell for more money than the 80GB&lt;/a> model retail price?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Disapointedly leaving the PS2 compatibility issue, &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2009/01/31/dlna-on-osx-done-right/">I got a DLNA server running&lt;/a> on my Mac. When I want to view media on that server, I have to use your &amp;quot;X media bar&amp;quot; menu. For some reason, some designer came up with the brilliant idea to seperate music, photo's and video's in that menu. This means that before browsing my DLNA server, I have to decide what filetype I'm going to browse. If I have folders containing both video and photo's of the same birthday party, I constantly have to back out of the photo viewing mode, get into the video mode, browse all the way back to the folder, and view the video. It's like having to fill in a form to flip the channel on your TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And what's with the forgetting of discovered DLNA servers? The PS3 takes ages to re-discover my DLNA server on the network each time I turn the PS3 on, or return to the menu from a game.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make it even more cringeworthy, the PS3 scares the crap out of me each time I browse to a folder to see that &amp;quot;There are no files...&amp;quot;. The PS3 is lying ofcourse, what it means is that there are MPG's and AVI's there, but I'm in photo viewing mode. The whole X-media-bar design must have never been usability tested by random customers. It's a very common practice nowadays which I can really recommend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By now, I had scored some PS3 games (&lt;a href="http://www.ps3home.nl/products/playstation-3-games/alle-games-a-tot-z/moto-gp-2008-ps3.htm">Moto GP&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.tombraiderunderworld.com">Tomb Raider: Underworld&lt;/a>). After a nice evening of gaming,Â  I discover that the controller battery is running low. So I connect it to the PS3, and put the PS3 in standby mode, expecting my controller to be charged the next morning. To my huge disapointment, the controller does not charge when the PS3 is not fully on. That strikes me as really strange. To charge my wireless controller, I have to connect it during gaming. Now how did someone on your design team did not notice that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a big old Phillips Matchline TV which worked fine, but was getting a bit dated. The thought of being able to play games in full HD 1080p resolution was very tempting, so I bought a new model Sony Bravia 40 inch TV, thinking that it would interface nicely with the PS3. To my absolute horror, the PS3 video signal looked horrible on this new TV. As it turned out, you are shipping this full HD 300+ dollar gaming machine with a crappy composite video cable. Oh boy. Now I know why people think the difference between a Wii and a PS3 is not that huge. Another obvious commercial win down the drain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I googled around and I discovered that HDMI is the best way to go. I bought an HDMI cable and connected the PS3 to the TV with that. The TV manual said it could use some HDMI protocol to discover HDMI connected devices. Surely enough, my brandnew Sony Bravia does not recognize my Sony PS3. How nice is that? Luckaly, after some manual fiddling with the absolutely horrid X-media bar-like menu's in the TV and the PS3, I got everything to play in full HD. Finally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What strikes me as another design flaw is the size of the screen fonts. On my big TV everything looks nice, but I can imagine that the paperboy who emptied his piggybank to get a PS3, and connects it to his little TV in his room, can not read any of the menu items. I take it that the Sony testing department only has Full HD TV's with HDMI cables, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then there's the whole casing design thing. Come on. Rounded top? I can not even place a controller on there, it slides off. The ventilation holes are on the side, which makes it imposible to put the PS3 with it's right side against the cupboard. The USB ports are recessed in such a way that if you place the PS3 low to the ground (which happens most), you can not see the ports without having to lie down on the floor eyeballing them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While you're down there, you can als see the rediculously thick and sturdy mains cable. It can transport enough current to power my microwave. Does the PS3 really use that much current? Now be honest. You could have selected a thinner, more flexible mains lead, and maybe it would even have been cheaper. The current lead almost pushes the PS3 out from the wall. Good thing the PS3 is so heavy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When waking the PS3 from it's sleep mode, there is another interesting thing that strikes me as odd. There is a green and a blue led next to eachother on the top of the button pannel. Not only are those two colors looking horrible next to eachother, and the fact that I have come to loathe any product with a blue led, there is absolutely no way that colorblind people are going to notice the difference in color, which makes them pointless.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I said, this is just a selection of the gripes I have with the design. For instance, the fact that game makers are allowed to play sounds and video as soon as a game is inserted, is just terrible. It scares the crap out of me each time I insert &lt;a href="http://www.racedrivergrid.com/">Race Driver:GRID&lt;/a>, and there is no way I can turn it off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="photo.jpg">&lt;img src="photo.jpg" alt="Sony Bravia remote button misplacement">
&lt;/a>The nicest example of hardware design failure by Sony is the remote control of the Sony Bravia TV. The buttons you use most are in fact unreachable when holding the remote in your hand. The least used buttons are right there by your thumb. What was this designer thinking? Oh and never mind pressing the buttons, because this TV, which can interpolate frames of a 24fps source into 100fps fluid motion while dynamically adjusting sound and backlight, has a very hard time to display a menu or react to the remote. This is absolutely mind boggling to me. It's like a race car which can go from 0 to 300mph in 2 seconds but takes 5 seconds to react to the brakes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I bought all this Sony stuff. I know, I could have bought something else. But there are reasons for me to put up with all this crap. OTHER manufacturers make such great stuff for Sony devices. The games on the PS3 are absolutely beautiful and brilliant. Watching video on the PSP on an airplane is great. Looking at a bluray at 100Hz 1080p on the Bravia is eye-popping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, dear mr. Morita, please, please make the people at Sony aware of these details. They're important. Solving them will set your product apart from the competition in a large way. People may not be able to tell why, but they will like your product better. This is what good designers do. Make a product have a good &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will also rid you of online video's describing your products as... well... you've already seen &lt;a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/video/sony_releases_new_stupid_piece_of">that video&lt;/a>, right?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading this rant.

&lt;p>This evening I came accross the window.moveBy() JavaScript function and thought it would be cool to shake the browser window when a user fails to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2006/11/02/it-aint-what-you-do/">log in&lt;/a>. It turns out that I was not the only one thinking this, but none of the examples worked for me. Some had &lt;a href="http://javascript.internet.com/image-effects/shake-screen.html">no proper delays&lt;/a>, others only worked from the page header, and some were &lt;a href="http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/jsquake/index.html">plain unreadable&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm no Javascript guru, but I hacked this together which is working pretty nicely. It is in fact almost undistinguishable from the Apple login window shake at a login failure:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;script type=&amp;quot;text/javascript&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
if (window.moveBy) {
delay = 70;
shakes = 3;
window.moveBy(-10, 0);
for (j = shakes; j &amp;gt; 0; j--) {
setTimeout( &amp;quot;window.moveBy(20, 0)&amp;quot;, j*delay );
setTimeout( &amp;quot;window.moveBy(-20, 0)&amp;quot;,
j*delay+(delay/2));
}
setTimeout( &amp;quot;window.moveBy(10, 0)&amp;quot;, (shakes+1)*delay );
}
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In my case, I surrounded this code with a Tapestry @Conditional and made it into a reusable Tapestry component so that I can make any window shake as soon as it contains an error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code will work anywhere on your page, but I advise you to put it at the bottom of the HTML. This will make sure that the content is shown in the browser before you shake it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's visually much stronger than just adding an errortext to the page. If people log in a couple of times a day, they don't even notice extra text on the screen. This will &amp;quot;shake&amp;quot; them awake :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LED's in your livingroom?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/03/08/leds-in-your-livingroom/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Mar 2009 21:29:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/03/08/leds-in-your-livingroom/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In some countries, there is some talk on &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_out_of_incandescent_light_bulbs">banishing the classic (incandescant) lightbulb&lt;/a>. I think this whole discussion is needless. The only reason why it exists, is that the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescent_light">fluorescent&lt;/a> bulbs are often of mediocre quality, and certain people are here to enforce their bad tastes upon us &amp;quot;for a greater purpose&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don't get me wrong, I really like trees and birds around my house, and I would be more than happy to install &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/05/02/give-me-spots-on-my-apples/">energy-efficient appliances&lt;/a> in my home, even if they cost me slightly more. But especially if I'm paying more, I expect to get a certain level of quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of the inefficiency of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incandescent_light_bulb">incandescent&lt;/a> bulbs, and the number of bulbs in my household, I decided to look around for energy efficient solutions. Particulary LED lighting caught my interest, because it is not only energy efficient, it's also dimmable with normal (cheap) floor dimmers. They even stay cold enough so that children touching them do not burn their fingers.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**The Search
&lt;p>**I went online, and looked around for LED bulbs which would fit in a normal E14 (small) socket. It was a long and hard search, because information on LED lighting is sparse, as if manufacturers don't want to sell them. I found this &amp;quot;Parlat&amp;quot; lamp at &lt;a href="http://www.ledgloeilamp.nl/LED-Gloeilampen-E27-E14/LED-lamp-E14-kaarsvorm/productdetails.tpl.htm">ledgloeilamp.nl&lt;/a> which promised to be &amp;quot;Warm White&amp;quot;, with a color temperature of 3000 Kelvin. Some Googling learned that a 2 Watt LED lamp is considered to be roughly equal to 30 Watts of incandescent light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**The Test Results
**&lt;a href="img_1203_text1.jpg">&lt;img src="img_1203_text1.jpg?w=72" alt="LED lighting, side-by-side comparison">
&lt;/a>In the picture on the right, you can see the result. The topmost bulb is a normal Phillips 25Watt &amp;quot;Warm White&amp;quot; lamp, which produces the expected &amp;quot;Incandescent&amp;quot; lighting. The wall behind is yellow by the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bottom bulb is a 25Watt &amp;quot;Terracotta&amp;quot; lamp, also from Phillips. This is the warmest color you can buy, and it's even slightly to yellow for my taste, but better than the normal white bulb.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The middle bulb is the Parlat &amp;quot;Warm White&amp;quot; 2Watt LED lamp. As you can see it is nowhere near &amp;quot;warm&amp;quot;. It produces an ugly green-blue-ish color which has a colder color temperature than the incandescent &amp;quot;Warm White&amp;quot;. The 2 Watts is not nearly enough to even maka the wall behind it light up in the photo. Because of the plastic LED housing in the bottom of the bulb, it is unable to produce an even light pattern, and results in ugly shades in my lamp cover.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Additional Field Work
**&lt;a href="img_0384.jpg">&lt;img src="img_0384.jpg?w=117" alt="LED lighting on display">
&lt;/a>Last weekend I got a tip from my dad, a local shop had some LED bulbs on display. To rule out the possibility of having bought a faulty lamp, I drove to the shop to take a look for myself. The result: I didn't even buy a lamp, I snapped a picture with my iPhone instead. The dark banding is caused by interference between the camera and the light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left are fluorescent bulbs, which look quite ok. On the right: LED lighting, again in the ugliest of all colors, even more blue than the one I ordered online. The lamps in the middle are also LED lights, but have more LED's in them and produce more light, and are slightly less &amp;quot;blue/gray&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**How to Improve
**I think the lighting industry needs someone with authority who can think, has authority, and some taste. LED lighting would be(come) a lot better if it did:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>Laboritory employee, proudly showing LED lamp: _"Look boss, we made this beautiful lamp. Here, let me turn it on for you"_
&lt;p>&lt;em>-plink-&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boss: &lt;em>&amp;quot;Ehm. right. What kind of color did you say this was?&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Employee, looks at the lamp and tries to lie at his boss the same way he is planning to lie to the customers: &lt;em>&amp;quot;Warm white ofcourse. We measured it at 3000K&amp;quot;.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boss: &lt;em>&amp;quot;It's not &amp;quot;Warm&amp;quot;, it's not &amp;quot;White&amp;quot;, it's not &amp;quot;3000K&amp;quot; and it's not beautiful. Do you know what this is?&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Employee, feeling like he has been caught: &lt;em>&amp;quot;No, what boss?&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boss: &lt;em>&amp;quot;The reason you are fired.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Â &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Final Thoughts
I think LED lighting is the future, and I really hope that it becomes a lot better. But until then, you have been warned. Don't buy LED (or any other) bulbs &amp;quot;unseen&amp;quot;. Don't go by the temperature or &amp;quot;equivalent watts&amp;quot; crap. Use your eyes and your brain.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>For now, I'm holding on to my beautiful incandescent lamps, and I will buy boatloads of them if the Dutch governement is stupid enough to think about banishing incandescent lamps without accurate, usable, affordable alternatives.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to put DVD's on your iPhone (for free)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/28/how-to-put-dvds-on-your-iphone-for-free/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2009 22:19:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/28/how-to-put-dvds-on-your-iphone-for-free/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-13a1.png" alt="For A Few Dollars More">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of companies like to sell you applications to put DVD's on your iPhone. Usually these apps are just wrappers around existing tools, and are pretty expensive if you consider you can do it for free. And you don't need to be a computer wizard either! The steps are simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Use [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/?article=download) to rip the DVD to iPhone format
2. Drag the generated mp4 file into iTunes
3. Sync it to your iPhone like all other content
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To show you exactly how this is done, I've Â written up this &amp;quot;babystep-by-babystep&amp;quot; tutorial. Let me show you how I ripped &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Few-Dollars-More-Clint-Eastwood/dp/0792839056">&amp;quot;For A Few Dollars More&amp;quot;&lt;/a> and put it on my iPhone:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Disclaimer: **The DVD I ripped is bought and payed for. This article does not relief you of your responsibility to obey the law, so please be careful. And be nice, don't pirate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->What You Need&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/?article=download) for ripping the DVD
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which is used by handbrake for DVD's with encodings not supported by Handbrake. You don't always need it, but download and install it anyway, just to be sure.
* Some patience.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1:Â Rip the DVD to an MP4&lt;/strong>
Put a DVD in your Mac, and stop the DVD player application if it opens automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-6.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-6.png?w=128" alt="Select VIDEO_TS folder">
&lt;/a>Start Handbrake. A selection window will open, use it to browse to the DVD, and select the VIDEO_TS folder (just select it, no need to go into it) and then press &amp;quot;Open&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-7.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-7.png" alt="Select Title and Chapters">
&lt;/a>Handbrake will briefly scan the DVD for titles. In the &amp;quot;Source:&amp;quot; section of the screen, select a title and the chapters you want to rip. Usually Handbrake guesses that it's the longest title, with the most chapters you want to rip. Let's go with those defaults.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-81.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-81.png?w=44" alt="Presets Selection Drawer">
&lt;/a>Press the &amp;quot;Toggle Presets&amp;quot; button on the top right, and select &amp;quot;iPhone&amp;quot; from the list that pops out on the right side of the Handbrake window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-10.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-10.png?w=120" alt="Select Audio and Subtitles">
&lt;/a>Next, click the &amp;quot;Audio and Subtitles&amp;quot; tab and select the audio and subtitles you want to listen and read in the ripped video. You can NOT change audio and subtitles later on your iPhone, so choose wisely. This is usually the step I forget, which requires me to wait for the whole ripping process again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-12.png" alt="afbeelding-12">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make sure the destination file is where you want it, and press the green &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; icon. Handbrake will start reading the DVD and create an MP4 file. This can take a while, so you might want to get a cocktail. Handbrake will show a progress bar in the icon in the dock.
Â 
&lt;strong>Step 2: Import into iTunes&lt;/strong>
After the ripping is done, you can add your mp4 file to the iTunes library by simply dragging the video file into iTunes. There you can set the title, year, genre and illustration exactly as you did with your music files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-14.png" alt="iTunes showing ripped DVD">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: Putting it on your iPhone&lt;/strong>
Plug in you iPhone. Go to the iPhone configuration and click on the &amp;quot;Video&amp;quot; tab. Scroll down, and select the video you just imported:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-15.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-15.png" alt="Sync the movie to the phone">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you press &amp;quot;Apply&amp;quot;, iTunes will immediately start copying the movie over to the iPhone, where you can find it in your iPhone in your iTunes library.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advanced Tips:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [![Few Dollars More on iPhone](img_0005.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](img_0005.png)The DVD I just converted (For A Few Dollars More) averaged out to about 3,5MB per minute. That's about 5 hours of video per GB, but your mileage mayÂ vary. On average you should be able to take at least one or to movies with you on your iPhone. If your music is in the way, you can &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/ipod-synchronization-techniques/">use these tips&lt;/a> to make iTunes organize your music for you.
* Handbrake has an &amp;quot;Add To Queue&amp;quot; button which lets you convert multiple movies in a row. In order for that to work you need to copy the VIDEO_TS folders of multiple DVD's onto a harddrive. Now you can convert multiple DVD's overnight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Are you a Wise person?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/18/are-you-a-wise-person/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2009 01:00:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/18/are-you-a-wise-person/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="duckedit.jpg" alt="Rubber Duck">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Ducks migrate for the winter, they are able to have their brain &lt;a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Can-Birds-Sleep-While-in-Flight-74549.shtml">partially asleep&lt;/a>. This comes in handy when you have to fly hours on end in a pack, without restbreaks. Aparently, people have started to adopt this habbit. Yes you've read that right. I've seen some very good examples of people using only one half of their brains.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Let me give you an example. Do you have healthcare insurance? Does that insurance company make nice promises about actually helping you get better? Does the commercial include smiling people being helped immediately by loving, caring, smiling people of the insurance company? Probably the answers to all those questions are yes.
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.png" alt="Machine has no brain">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Those of you who were unfortunate enough to actually have had to collect healthcare, know it's different. First of all, they require you to go through lengthy procedures with lots of forms which take sometimes months to process. Never mind if you lost your hand and can't fill them in, you'll get them anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, the hospital wants to get paid, so you need to use your life savings to do that, hoping you will get it back from the insurance company later, which is somethimes very unlikely. And although they make you think otherwise, insurance companies actually start blabbering about insuring the &lt;em>cause&lt;/em>, not the &lt;em>damage&lt;/em>. Now what customer cares about that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All these people could actually know how you're feeling, but they choose not to. They might even know how to really help you, but that part of their brain has been in sleep mode for years. They hide behind the rules and procedures, and lie about being &amp;quot;unable&amp;quot; to bend them. You could be one of those people, maybe even without knowing. Can you figure out what the intention was behind the rules and procedures, instead of just folowing them? If you're wise enough, you could probably find a way to actually understand and help your customers, maybe even without bending rules.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/rolfje">&lt;img src="twitter-logo.png" alt="Twitter">
&lt;/a>About a week ago, I was a bit bored and decided to see what Twitter is all about. I created an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje">account&lt;/a>, and I Tweeted for a week. I tried to keep to the original idea, where a Tweet should answer the question &amp;quot;What are you doing&amp;quot;?Â Looking back, my tweets includeÂ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1198486833">Coffee&lt;/a>,Â &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1199748992">Podcasts&lt;/a>,Â &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1200610213">Global frustration&lt;/a>,Â &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1203692363">Small joys&lt;/a>,Â &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1206502512">Small irritations&lt;/a>,Â &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1209317512">Re-tweets&lt;/a>, andÂ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rolfje/statuses/1209634779">Replies&lt;/a>.Â &lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Twitter is a service were you can send short texts of 140 characters or less, called "tweets". These texts end up on a webpage, resulting in a micro-blog for all to read. Think of it as SMS-ing to your blog. One of the fun parts of Twitter is that people find really creative ways to express themselves in 140 characters or less. This allows you to follow an amazing amount of people, getting short messages about what they're doing, such as ["is relaxing with the wife and kids..... at home"](https://twitter.com/richard_hammond/statuses/1209417438) Â or Â  ["Great meal at Michael Minna with my best gal"](https://twitter.com/ev/statuses/1211691640).
&lt;table border="0" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >!["at"](afbeelding-1.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Should you find a "Tweet" you think is interesting, you can reply to that person (not to the tweet directly) by starting your tweet with an "@" and the username of the person you want to reply to.Â 
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >!["hash"](afbeelding-2.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >You can even "tag" your Tweets by using a "#" and a word. So for instance "#rolfje" would add the tag "rolfje" to my Tweet. You can then easily [search tweets with this tag](http://hashtags.org/tag/rolfje). Tags are sometimes used to create something of a "communications channel". For instance, the [#followfriday](http://hashtags.org/tag/followfriday) tag is used to tweet about people you think are worth following.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>
Starting in the US, Twitter is becoming increasingly popular all over the world, now taking over Europe. [BBC had an item](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7287536.stm) on English television about twitter, massively increasing the number of English twitterers.Â 
&lt;p>And ofcourse, where there are people, there are money-sharks to spoil the fun. Some companies are showing up, and are clearly not understanding what Twitter is about. They start a twitter account and twitter promotional messages, product releases, etc. The problem with this (for the company) is that for this to be succesful, people must follow you. If there's nothing interesting to read, people will not follow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This same problem occurs with people who have their staff update their twitter accounts. This makes for really uninteresting, unpersonal tweets, and replying to them will almost never result in a nice conversation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://pcweenies.com">&lt;img src="http://laikaspoetnik.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/twitter-addicts.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**What I used:
**During my Tweetweek, I tried different OSX and iPhone clients.Â There are a lot of clients out there, but none of them are good enough to be your &amp;quot;single client of choice&amp;quot;.Â Here's what I think of them, in short:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.twhirl.org/">Twhirl&lt;/a>: Done in Adobe AIR, multi-platform and consistent accross OS's. Good for a Windows app, terrible for an OSX app. Settings are in strange places, not clear what the &amp;quot;narrow&amp;quot; column mode is for. Ugly but probably the best twitter client out there, with twitpic and tinyurl integration all out of the box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/">Tweetdeck&lt;/a>: Also done in Adobe AIR, mutli-platform and consistent. Works fine, has multiple columns for monitoring your tweets, search results and profiles. Feels a bit funny, for instance the same icon is used for &amp;quot;show input window&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;send tweet&amp;quot;. It works, but it doesn't fit the &amp;quot;clean and simple&amp;quot; design I think a twitter client needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific&lt;/a>: Nice design, clean. Not much features, too overpriced.Â If Twitterific had tinyURL and twitpic integration, and sold for about $5, it would be a huge hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=296415944&amp;amp;mt=8">Tweetie (iPhone)&lt;/a>: The funny thing is that &amp;quot;Tweetie&amp;quot;, the iPhone twitter client is way better than any of the clients I tried on a normal computer.Â Tweetie wins hands down. The best twitter client for the iPhone, simple and clean, camera integration, GPS integration. This also fits way better in the twitter philosophy, Tweeting whatever you are doing, wherever you are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What I learned:&lt;/strong>
Twitter is for everyday people, like you and me, and feels like a mix between &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens'_Band_Radio">CB radio&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texting">texting&lt;/a>. Twitter is all about you and who you follow. It's definetely not about your followers. Ofcourse you can try to get as much followers as possible, but I think that does not guarantee a nice twitter experience. Some people think it's rude not to follow back if they're followed, and will tweet to let somebody know that they're being &amp;quot;un-followed&amp;quot;. I think that's not how the system is supposed to work. There's also no real relationship. Follow or unfollow, it's not like you're devorcing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just Tweet, and see what happens. There's no currency, only small text messages from people around the world for you to read and reply to. Or not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Rip and Convert FLAC, M4A, MP3, AAC files</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/14/rip-and-convert-flac-m4a-mp3-aac-files/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2009 21:03:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/14/rip-and-convert-flac-m4a-mp3-aac-files/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I searched for a converter and found this wonderful converter which can just about convert any audio format out there.Â It's called &lt;a href="http://sbooth.org/Max">&amp;quot;Max&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, it's Open Source, free to use, and available as bundled OSX application. Brilliant! It does have a bunch of options, but as long as you go for the &amp;quot;MP4 Audio&amp;quot; output format, high quiality, 256 bits and VBR, you can't go wrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to their website &lt;em>&amp;quot;Max can generate audio in over 20 compressed and uncompressed formats including MP3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, AAC, Apple Lossless, Monkey's Audio, WavPack, Speex, AIFF, and WAVE&amp;quot;&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy transcoding!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bill's Mosquitoes</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/06/bills-mosquitoes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2009 21:17:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/02/06/bills-mosquitoes/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>Bill Gates found a very good way to get the news reporters to pay attention to the malaria problem. In his talk at the TED conference, he released a few mosquitoes, stating that malaria should not be just for poor people to experience. People who did not see the whole performance may react shocked, because when placed out of context it sounds like an outrageous thing to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think that's the case, you should maybe &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/451">have a look at his talk&lt;/a>, available (for free, without registering) at TED.com. You'll see that the audience is actually laughing when he releases the mosquitoes, and at the end of the talk Bill gets a standing ovation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">&lt;img src="200x150_playstation3_logo1.jpg" alt="Sony PS3 Logo">
&lt;/a>My wife bought me a playstation 3 last year, and I've enjoyed many hours of gaming on it, finishing Tomb Raider underworld, and now making decent progress in Ratchet and Clank: Tools of Destruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.dlna.org/home">&lt;img src="afbeelding-22.png" alt="DLNA logo">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was a bit sceptical about the DLNA capabilities of the PS3, because I read a lot of bad news on this fairly newÂ  &amp;quot;Interoperability Guidelines&amp;quot; concept. It sounded like a lot of trouble to go through to simply watch the photos and home videos on a TV. For weeks, I was not able to find a single site telling me how to install a DLNA server on my Mac, or where to find a decent one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Altgough they're hard to find, there are a few OSX DLNA servers out there. One of them is actually very good. Here's what I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**CyberMediaGate**
&lt;p>I found a DLNA server implemented in Java, and didn't get it to work. It misses a Xerces library and I can not seem to get the right version added to the classpath. I decided this was not very &amp;quot;Mac like&amp;quot; and dumped it. Not being able to install software &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot; may be normal on Linux, but is unaccepatble on a Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TwonkyMedia&lt;/strong>
Then, I came across TwonkyMedia. This was the first DLNA server I actually got to work on my Mac, and had it serving video to my PS3. It is a strange (wonky?) piece of software, had no native GUI and only lives on your machine as a webapplication. The installer copies &amp;quot;TwonkyMediaServer.app&amp;quot; in your application folder, starts it, and then opens a browser which points to the local URL of it's configuration screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that moment, it already is serving clients, but when you try to access it with the PS3, you will get a protocol error. This is because TwonkyMedia does not come with a default server name. The PS3 aparently can not handle an empty server name. After filling it in and restarting Twonky, I could access it with the PS3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TwonkyMedia does not look very Mac-like, and I don't like the looks of the webpage it is serving. The installer leaves two webloc files on your desktop which point to the configuration screens. It's a bit strange but it gets the job done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Potentially Twonky can do a bit more than CyberMediaGate. Twonky can do some transcoding and other streaming stuff, but I did not try that because I simply wanted to see my photo's and home video's on my TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trial version of Twonkymedia last for 30 days, but on the first day it already started acting up on me, and I had to restart it a few times while watching video. The look and feel, and the crashes didn't feel like it was worth the $40 to me, so I uninstalled it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uninstalling TwonkyMedia requires you to kill the process from the Terminal, and thenÂ drag TwonkyMediaServer.app to your trashcan. Another way is dragging the app to the trashcan and then restarting your Mac (not mac-like but it works).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>MediaLink&lt;/strong>
&lt;a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/medialink">&lt;img src="printablelogo.png" alt="Nullriver Logo">
&lt;/a>The nullriver homepage looked very elegant, and promising. A simple page explains what it is, what it does, and what it costs. Nullriver also allows you to send requests and reports on their site without registering (in contract with TwonkyMedia, to which you have to &amp;quot;sell your soul&amp;quot;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nullriver Medialink comes as a preference pane application, and has a beautifuly simple interface, with not many options. It integrates with your mac applications like iTunes, iPhoto and now even Aperture. It does not have all the fancy configuration options of TwonkyMedia. One of my small complaints is that your content is shared to all DLNA clients on your local network, which may not be what you want if you have more than one DLNA client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me MediaLink is a perfect fit. I control my own network, my PS3 is my only DLNA client so I don't need the fancy stuff. Most people will be perfectly happy with Medialink. It's simple, transparent, drag-and-drop, has a &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; button and is cheap. It does not have all the fancy features, but all the features that are in there work flawlessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I played with it for more than a week now, and so far it hasn't crashed on me. I did need to buy a registration key, because the trial version only lasts you for about 30 minutes of watching content (which should be plenty to try it out, and it's not like the 20 bucks are going to kill you).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>
Once again, all DLNA servers I tried put together:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.png" alt="Remote Desktop Connection icon">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;Remote Desktop Connection.app&amp;quot;Â allows you to see the desktop of a remote Windows machine on your mac.Â This application will not update itself automatically, unless you have it installed as part of the Microsoft Office for Mac suite. If you've downloaded the 1.0.3 version you probably did not notice thatÂ &amp;quot;Remote Desktop Connection.app&amp;quot; was updated somewhere last year by microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find the latest version of Remote Desktop Connection on the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/remote-desktop/default.mspx">Microsoft Mactopia&lt;/a> site. Version 2 is an improvement over 1.0.3 (which I had). Notable differences are:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Nicer configuration screens, makes configuring your resolution and shares easier.
* Now a Universal Binary, which should improve performance on Intel Macs. I have not noticed improvement, but that's probably because the network is the bottleneck.
* Supports the new RDC 6.0 protocol used by Vista.
* Can do authentication of the remote machine (if it's a Vista machine).
* Your Mac printer can be exposed to the Windows machine so you can print documents on your local printer.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I played with it for a while, and apart form the new looks I can not say it's very different from the 1.0.x version. It could load my old RDC 1.0.3 configuration files. If you need to connect to a Windows desktop from your Mac, this does the job just fine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Buddha had a stroke</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/01/21/buddha-had-a-stroke/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 22:03:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/01/21/buddha-had-a-stroke/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.drjilltaylor.com/">&lt;img src="a3e21e0649e9184e84173c7c12eb10cd.jpeg" alt="Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor">
&lt;/a>Here's Jill Bolte Taylor. She's a brain scientist, studying schyzofrenia, and the micro-circuitry in the human brain which causes these (and other) mental illenesses. On the morning of September 10, 1996 she had a stroke. Amongst all other things that went though her head, she realized that this was a tremendous oportunity because she got to study this phenomena first hand. Luckaly, she fully recovered, wrote a book about it, and did a very impressive presentation about it at the 2008 TED conference, called &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/jill_bolte_taylor_s_powerful_stroke_of_insight.html">&amp;quot;a powerful stroke of insight&amp;quot;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having watched this presentation, I realized that Zen monks already figured this out a long time ago, without knowing that they were talking about left or right brain halves. Here's a short recap of what your left and right brain halves do:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Right Half**
&lt;p>&lt;img src="human-brain.png" alt="Real Human Brain, held by Jill Bolte Taylor">
The right half of your brain is a paralel processor. It processes all the information coming in from your bodies' sensory system. It is concious of your body, it's current dimensions, it's current position. Your right half connects you to the world around you. It does not care about where you were 5 minutes ago, or where you are going. The right brain half lives in what Zen monks are calling &amp;quot;the here and now&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Left Half&lt;/strong>
The left brainhalf is a serial processor. It processes the information gathered by the right half, and stores it into memory. It is very linear and methodical. It associates the information of the right half with memories it stored, and projects things into the future. It's your left brain half which is reminding you to pick up the laundry, or go to the dentist. Your left half is also considered to contain your &amp;quot;ego&amp;quot;, and opposed to your right half, it is seperating you from the rest of the world. The left brain half contains the things Zen monks consider to be less usesful, like &amp;quot;regret&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;want&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enso">&lt;img src="496de0282ed5598be80c6ab014a5b104.jpeg" alt="Enso">
&lt;/a>When Jill talks about what she sees as &amp;quot;Lalaland&amp;quot;, I think it has a great resemblance to what Zen monks believe to be &amp;quot;enlightenment&amp;quot; or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhi">&amp;quot;Bodhi&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. It is a state in which the mind is freed from suffering and worries. Without maybe realizing, Zen monks know how to disconnect their left and right brain, or at least shut down a large part of their left brain. This has even &lt;a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2518618">measured in an MRI experiment&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zen Buddhism, is largely based around a story, which describes how a normal man called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Gautama Buddha&lt;/a> reached this state of enlightenment. After that, he set out to tell other people how to do this, and this has more or less lead to the whole Zen culture we know now.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combining the story about Gautama Buddha and Jill's talk, I think we can say that Jill was &amp;quot;uncontrolled enlighted&amp;quot; taken one step further than what we would consider to be practical. I also think that we have to consider the posibilty that Buddha just had a stroke, survived, and lived on to tell about it, just like Jill.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automount network shares</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/01/18/automount-network-shares/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2009 01:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2009/01/18/automount-network-shares/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="afp-or-smb.png">&lt;img src="afp-or-smb.png" alt="Choose AFP or SMB, not both.">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently upgraded the operating system on my trusty &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2006/09/20/tryout-mac-mini-as-fileserver/">Mac Mini G4 home fileserver&lt;/a> from Tiger to Leopard. In addition to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_%28Apple_software%29">out-of-the-box backup&lt;/a>, I no longer have to use &lt;a href="http://www.hornware.com/sharepoints/">SharePoints&lt;/a> to manage my network shares. In Leopard, I can just right-click them and arrange the sharing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In doing so, I decided to switch on both SMB and AFP sharing for all shares. The idea was that my Macs all would use AFP automatically, and all Windows machines would see the SMB mounts. After a few hours, iTunes began acting up on me, because it decided to switch between the SMB and AFP protocol (or so it seemed). Finder also seems to have some trouble listing network shares if the exact same name on the same server is shared with two different protocols.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because there are people on my network with Windows machines, I decided to switch off the AFP protocol and only go with SMB. I haven't had problems since.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're sharing drives like I'm doing, go for SMB. It may not be the technically superior solution, but it will &amp;quot;just work&amp;quot;. You can easily switch to AFP when the world is freed of Windows machines. ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We are Free!

&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-2-copy.png" alt="SQuireL SQL on OSX with Oracle drivers">
If you're a SQuirreL SQL fan like me, and you use a Mac, you probably also want to know how to add a driver to the OSX version of the application. Most people just point to an external jar file, but you can also add drivers to the application bundle. Â There's not much to it, but it took me some time to discover that I actually had to edit the plist file in the bundle after adding the driver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see on the left, my SQuireLSQL.app now comes with the Oracle OCI and Thin driver built in, and because they are part of the application bundle, I can't wreck my installation by misplacing jarfiles or reconfiguring classpaths. Nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to drivers to your SQuireLSQL.app yourself, here's what you need to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Download Â and unpack SQuirreL SQL for OSX.
2. Verify that is starts up, and that your drivers are missing. Close SQuirreL again.
3. Right-click on SQuireLSQL.app and select &amp;quot;show package contents&amp;quot;.
4. Browse to the **Contents/Resources/Java/lib** folder. Copy the jar file of your driver into this folder (I used ojdbc14.jar in this example)
5. Double-click the **Contents/Info.plist** file. The default plist editor will show up.
6. In the plist editor, find the **&amp;quot;Information Property List&amp;quot;/ Java/ClassPath** property.
7. At the end of the value in this property, add a colon, and a reference to your copied library. In our example (see step 4) I had to add **&amp;quot;:$JAVAROOT/lib/ojdbc14.jar&amp;quot;**, excluding quotes, but including the colon (see other libraries in the path and use them as examples.
8. Save the plist file, and double-click SQuireLSQL.app. Your driver should now have a blue checkmark next to it.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that now you've added proprietary drivers to the bundle, you can no longer freely distribute it. Usage and distribution of your version of SQuireLSQL.app is now &amp;quot;contaminated&amp;quot; by the licences of the driver(s) you installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy SQL-ing!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eclipse 3.4.1, OSX and Java 1.6</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/28/eclipse-341-osx-and-java-16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2008 14:05:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/28/eclipse-341-osx-and-java-16/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-22.png" alt="Eclipse application icon">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently downloaded &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/ganymede/SR1/eclipse-java-ganymede-SR1-macosx-carbon.tar.gz">Eclipse 3.4.1 for Mac OSX&lt;/a>, and tried starting it using the eclipse.app icon. It did not work, and I noticed a message in /var/log/system.log telling me that the JVM could not be loaded.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->After some Googling, I found out that Eclipse is not compatible with the new 64bit version of JDK 1.6 for the Mac. After switching back to 1.5 (luckaly Apple ships all JVM's with it's OS) it all worked. Here's how you switch back to JDK 1.5 on a Mac:
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cdÂ /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions
sudo ln -fhsv 1.5 CurrentJDK
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This makes the CurrentJDK link to point to the 1.5 installation of the Java JDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bonus tip for today: While you're at it, increase the memory used by eclipse by opening the eclipse.app bundle (right click -&amp;gt; show package contents) and edit Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini. Change the &amp;quot;-Xmx256m&amp;quot; line to read &amp;quot;-Xmx512m&amp;quot;, and eclipse should be much happier with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse there's &lt;a href="http://help.eclipse.org/stable/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">lots more you can do there&lt;/a>, but I always say &amp;quot;keep it simple&amp;quot;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hex color picker for OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/24/hex-color-picker-for-osx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2008 20:20:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/24/hex-color-picker-for-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-11.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-11.png?w=182" alt="Hex Color Picker Screenshot">
&lt;/a>If you're working on some source code and you quickly need to insert a hexadecimal color code for a color you currently have on your screen, then here is a neat little trick I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, install &lt;a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color Picker&lt;/a> by Waffle software. It will add an extra option to the built-in OSX color picker to show you the selected color in Hex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reach the color picker, you usually start up any application which uses the standard OSX color picker and just choose &amp;quot;choose color&amp;quot;. What you can also do, is have the OSX color picker behave as a &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060408050920158&amp;amp;lsrc=osxh">standalone application&lt;/a> in 3 simple steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open &amp;quot;ScriptEditor&amp;quot;, the Applescript editor.
2. In the main window, type &amp;quot;choose color&amp;quot;
3. Save the script as an application.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The saved application will, you guessed it, show you the standard color picker. Add it to the dock and you will be a happy developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note&lt;/strong>**:** If you are really being a perfectionist, it is possible this will not work for you because the color profiles of you monitor and possibly the profiles which are applied by Safari will introduce errors, because the color picker shows you the color which is on the screen, not the original color coming from the application. There's a whole slew of documentation on color profiles and I do have a whole rant which I will save you from reading (for now).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.uweschmidt.org/wiimote-whiteboard">&lt;img src="wiimotewhiteboard_128.png" alt="WiimoteWhiteboard">
&lt;/a>For people wanting to have an interactive whiteboard but don't have the money, &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/">Johnny Chung Lee&lt;/a>Â has found the solution. Using a Wiimote, he can track an infrared lightsource (like an LED) and use that to control the mousecursor. I tried some software on the Mac and the PC, and I actually got both to work without too much trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The infra-red pen&lt;/strong>
Please note that you need some kind of Infra-Red emitting device. In my first tests to see if the software works, I used a TV remote. This is a bit clunky, so next on my list is to build a simple infra-red pen this weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I noticed a lot of people building infra-red pens by directly connecting an LED to a battery, which will possibly ruin your LED very quickly because there's too much current running through it. An LED is a diode, and it needs to be limited in current. The only right way to do it is follow &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/pen.jpg">Johnny's schematic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Whiteboard app on the Mac:
I was amazed about how well this worked. I was expecting a lot of experimental stuff, but instead, this is all you have to do:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [![](afbeelding-21.png?w=47)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](afbeelding-21.png)Download &lt;a href="http://www.uweschmidt.org/files/WiimoteWhiteboard.dmg">WiimoteWhiteboard for the Mac&lt;/a> by Uwe Schmidt.
2. Enable bluetooth on your mac.
3. Start the WiimoteWhiteboard.app
4. On the Wiimote, press buttons 1 and 2 simultaniously to put it in &amp;quot;detectable&amp;quot; mode. If the Wiimote was already on, you may need to press the red button in the battery compartment.
5. After pairing is complete, press the &amp;quot;calibrate&amp;quot; button and follow the instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did these steps on an intel Â Mac mini and it worked beautifully. You can pair up to 2 Wiimotes to increase reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Whiteboard app on the PC:
This is slightly more work, but does not include steps which are strange to regular Windows users:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Download and install the [.Net framework version 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&amp;amp;displaylang=en)
2. Download Boon Jin's [Smoothboard](http://www.boonjin.com/wp/2008/08/14/wiimote-smoothboard-045-beta)Â for Windows.
3. [![XP Bluetooth Wizard Screen 1](clipboard02.png)

4. In the system tray on your Windows, right-click the bluetooth icon, and choose &amp;quot;Add a Bluetooth Device&amp;quot;
5. Click the &amp;quot;My device is set up and ready to be connected&amp;quot; checkbox.

&lt;/a>Press the red button of the Wiimote (in the battery compartement) to unpair it from anything else and get into &amp;quot;detecable&amp;quot; mode.
7. Click the &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button in the Wizzard
8. Select the &amp;quot;Nintendo RVL-CNT-01&amp;quot; device and click &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot;
9. &lt;a href="clipboard04.png">&lt;img src="clipboard04.png?w=124" alt="XP Bluetooth Wizard Screen 3">
&lt;/a>Select the &amp;quot;Don't use a passkey&amp;quot; radio button and DON'T press &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot;.
10. Press the little red button on the Wiimote again, so that all blue lights start flashing, and then press &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; on the wizard.
11. In the tray, you should now see popups saying &amp;quot;Found new hardware&amp;quot; and something like &amp;quot;New HID device&amp;quot;. They will dissapear after a while. If the popups did not show, start the whole process again from step 4.
12. Press &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; in the Wizard, notice that the Wiimote keeps flashing all the lights.
13. Start Smoothboard. The Wiimote should stop flashing, and you can click on the &amp;quot;Calibrate&amp;quot; button to start the fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="clipboard05.png">&lt;img src="clipboard05.png?w=33" alt="Smoothboard Screenshot">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've tested the Windows setup on a Dell 530 laptop with the built-in bluetooth device, and it works fine, although I did have to reboot once because the bluetooth stack got confused and refused to detect my Wiimote. Smoothboard also allows you to pair 2 Wiimotes to improve reliability. It also has many features which are tailored to controling Powerpoint and other software, but I haven't tried that yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Micro Victories</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/11/micro-victories/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Dec 2008 20:26:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/11/micro-victories/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="trophy_icon.gif" alt="Trophy">
The last few weeks I was frustrated about not being able to write any code for the project I am on at work. My days are filled with email, &lt;a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.276499.40">spreadsheets&lt;/a>, documents, discussions and distractions. All important stuff, I'm sure, but none of it has got to do with actual coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to write code during the evenings for that project, just to get my kicks. Two things happened:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Frustration grew, because I feel that this is the kind of work I should be doing during the day.Â 
2. As I worked the late night hours, I realized I could never get it all done because the blocks of work were simply to large and required too much research to be done during a few evenings.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;!-- more -->In the midst of this all, I held a presentation about Coding Quality at work. The presentation was all about taste, caring for a good product, and putting some love and care into your code. That, and the whole [continuous integration](http://clintshank.javadevelopersjournal.com/ci_build_game.htm) and [unittests](http://junit.sourceforge.net/doc/testinfected/testing.htm) stuff ofcourse. During the questions session, the [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) plugin for Eclipse came up. This is a plugin I have installed, but I rarely find/make the time for working through the warnings it genereates.
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://video.google.de/videoplay?docid=7209282843949564567&amp;amp;q=insect+animation">&lt;img src="spider.jpg" alt="Bug and Spider">
&lt;/a>I did a small demo of Findbugs, and it sure worked. There they were, the stupid mistakes in my code, on the beamer, in front of all my collegues. Ofcourse Murphy says that any beamer will always be at it's sharpest and brightest when your slide has an error on it. In my case, even the people in the far back could clearly read the tiniest font in my edit window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Back home, I knew there is no way I can get these fixed during working hours, so I created a seperate Eclipse installation at home running Findbugs. As I started fixing some of the most humilliating little bugs, I found out that I couldn't stop. I spent the whole evening tinkering with the code, and it fealt great. Today I suddenly realized why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Findbugs presents me with little things I can do within 5 minutes each, and when done, there is that next one looking at me. Not surprising, this is also the recipe for &lt;a href="http://www.gamegirl.com/article/105406/top-7-addictive-video-games/">addictive video games&lt;/a>. You can pick the game up and get right in, and you can stop at any time, but you don't want to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every 5 minutes, I solve a bug, run unittest, commit to CVS and feel good about having done that. It's a string of Micro Victories which are really thrilling and relaxing at the same time. There's &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/carl_honore_praises_slowness.html">no time pressure&lt;/a>, no requirements, just me, my good taste and a good feeling for each little bug solved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brilliant TV</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/08/brilliant-tv/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Dec 2008 22:46:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/12/08/brilliant-tv/</guid><description>
&lt;p>People who know me know that I'm not a big fan of commercial TV. It hasn't got any depth, it usually underproduced, overmarketed and makes an insulting assumption on the viewer's intelligence. (Wow, all in one sentence :-) )&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I usually get my information elsewhere. Most of the stuff I find interesting is provided through &lt;a href="http://antipattern.wordpress.com/2008/11/08/software-engineering-is-my-profession-programming-is-my-hobby/">RSS feeds&lt;/a>. Some of it is made available through &lt;a href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/">audio podcasts&lt;/a>, which is brilliant when commuting. As for video, youtube looked promising, but the messy interface and sheer overload of people making silly movies with their mobile phones has made it hard for me to find actual interesting video there. The rating system with YouTube did improve the past week, but it's still hard to find stuff that interests me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enter the TED talks. These are brilliant video's mostly of a &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/raul_midon_plays_all_the_answers_and_tembererana.html">presentation&lt;/a>, or sometimes &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/raul_midon_plays_all_the_answers_and_tembererana.html">music&lt;/a>. But generally, the TED talks are just that tiny bit more interesting than TV, without commercials, and with real contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just now I finished watching Mena Trott's entertaining presentation on &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/mena_trott_tours_her_blog_world.html">how blogs are building a friendlier world&lt;/a>. The &lt;a href="http://www.ted.com/">TED.com&lt;/a> site is really clean, easy to browse and contains tons of video's about remarkable people with very interesting stories to tell. If my TV died, the only way I'd notice is when I switch on my PS3 to play a video game.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monkeys: How to get rich.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/11/23/monkeys-how-to-get-rich/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Nov 2008 10:38:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/11/23/monkeys-how-to-get-rich/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I recently got an email with a brilliant little fairytale about how to trick people into happily giving you all their money.Â I wanted to share with you, but it was in Dutch, and the origin was cleary not the original author.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today I was &lt;a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/rummaging">rummaging&lt;/a> around the internet to see if I could find the original author, and I did. I found out that the Dutch story was freely translated from an English source. Here's the original story from that English source, unaltered (and with reference):&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;blockquote>**Monkeys**
&lt;p>Once upon a time in a village, a man appeared and announced to the villagers that he would buy monkeys for $5 each. The villagers seeing that there were many monkeys around, went out to the forest and started catching them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man bought thousands at $5 and as supply started to diminish, the villagers stopped their effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He further announced that he would now buy at $10. This renewed the efforts of the villagers and they started catching monkeys again. Soon the supply diminished even further and people started going back to their farms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The offer increased to $15 each and the supply of monkeys became so little that it was an effort to even see a monkey, let alone catch it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The man now announced that he would buy monkeys at $50. However, since he had to go to the city on some business, his assistant would now buy on his behalf.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the manâs absence, the assistant told the villagers âLook at all these monkeys in the big cage that the man has collected. I will sell them to you at $45 and when the man returns from the city, you can sell them to him for $50 each.â&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The villagers rounded up with all their savings and bought all the monkeys. Then they never again saw the man nor his assistant, only monkeys everywhere!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And THAT ladies and gentleman is how the stock market worksâ¦&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We've probably all had it. Just when you thought you found the right number of &lt;a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&amp;amp;id=125">Palindromic Square Sums&lt;/a>, you receive a mail from somewhere up the chain of command with a cry for help.

At the end of the mail, there is a fairly trivial question like &amp;quot;How many pounds is in one kilogram&amp;quot;?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So you search Google and find out that 1 kilogram isÂ 2.20462262 pounds. Depending on your irritation, you mail the information, or a link to the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=1+kilo+in+pounds">google results&lt;/a> (because it is a top hit).

&lt;p>&lt;img src="oracle_logo_small.gif" alt="Oracle Logo">
At work, we've got two Oracle databases and a Java web application. One of the tasks of the web application is to copy tables over from one database to the other. Last week we ran into a funny problem which turns out to be an Oracle bug.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've posted a question about this last week on &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/253971/why-does-char1-change-to-char3-when-copying-over-an-oracle-dblink">stackoverflow.com&lt;/a> but it seems that not many people are affected by this particular problem, or at least not many people know the answer to this particular little problem. We set out to tackle this and we did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**&lt;!-- more -->The Setup
** We have two databases, andÂ want to transfer a complete table from the remote database to the local database, using a database link and a &amp;quot;create table as select&amp;quot;.Â For both databases, we can find the version and used character set with a few simple queries:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>select * from v$version where banner like 'Oracle%';&lt;/p>
&lt;p>select value from NLS_DATABASE_PARAMETERS
where parameter='NLS_CHARACTERSET';&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The results in our setup are:&lt;/p>
&lt;table border="0" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Â 
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**Version**
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**Character set**
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >**Remote:**
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Oracle 10g Release 10.2.0.3.0
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >WE8ISO8859P1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >**Local:**
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Oracle 9i Release 9.2.0.6.0
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >AL32UTF8
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>
As you see, we transfer data between different versions of Oracle, and different character sets. Add the CHAR datatype into the mix, and an annoying little bug pops up.
&lt;p>**The Test Data
** On the remote database, we create a table and fill it with some fake data, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>create table foo
Â Â Â (vcharbyte varchar2(1 byte),
Â Â Â Â vcharchar varchar2(1 char),
Â Â Â Â charbyte Â char(1 byte),
Â Â Â Â charchar Â char(1 char));&lt;/p>
&lt;p>insert into foo
Â Â Â Â values ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D');&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let's check how the datatypes of our new table look:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>select column_name, data_type,
data_length as bytes,
char_length as chars
from user_tab_columns
where table_name like 'FOO';&lt;/p>
&lt;table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" border="1" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr bgcolor="#dddddd" >
COLUMN_NAME
DATA_TYPE
BYTES
CHARS
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >VCHARBYTE
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >VARCHAR2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >VCHARCHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >VARCHAR2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >CHARBYTE
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >CHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >CHARCHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >CHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>
Everything looks fine. In the remote database, the data types are 1 byte in size, and 1 character in length, as expected.
&lt;p>**Copying the table over
** Log on to the local database. Setup a link to the remote database and create a local table with a &amp;quot;create table as select&amp;quot; statement:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>create database link foo_link
connect to foodb
identified by foodb
using 'foo_tns_entry';&lt;/p>
&lt;p>create table bar as
select * from foo@foo_link;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everthing seems to be ok, and selecting the new data on the &amp;quot;bar&amp;quot; table seems to work. But there's a snag. When using JDBC to connect to the database, you might notice that the CHARBYTE column is padded with 2 spaces. Why? First we look at what happened to our data types:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>select column_name, data_type,
data_length as bytes,
char_length as chars
from user_tab_columns
where table_name like 'BAR'&lt;/p>
&lt;table cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" border="1" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr bgcolor="#dddddd" >
COLUMN_NAME
DATA_TYPE
BYTES
CHARS
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >CHARBYTE
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >CHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**3**
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**3**
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >CHARCHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >CHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >4
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >VCHARBYTE
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >VARCHAR2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**3**
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >**3**
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >VCHARCHAR
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >VARCHAR2
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >4
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >1
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>
You may notice something funny going on here. As mentioned earlier, the remote database uses theÂ WE8ISO8859P1 character set, which uses 1 byte to store a character. The local database uses the AL32UTF8 character set, which uses 3 to 4 bytes to store a character. So in order to copy characters over Oracle reserves 4 bytes per character (see CHARCHAR and VCHARCHAR columns).
&lt;p>For the data types we defined the size in bytes in, Oracle reserves 3 bytes for some reason. This is strange, because the AL32UTF8 character set has some 4 byte characters in it which never can be stored in those columns. Suppose Oracle says &amp;quot;but you defined length in bytes&amp;quot;, it still doesn't make sense. Why would I not choose to do conversion, but still reserve 3 times as much space for each byte? But wait, that's not all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets look at the length of the datatypes in characters (which makes much more sense). When we define the length of the original column in characters, oracle converts the data properly, as you see for the &amp;quot;CHARCHAR&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;VCHARCHAR&amp;quot; columns. But, for the columns we defined size in bytes, Oracle screws up. Not only the the number of bytes gets scaled up, but the &lt;strong>number of characters also gets scaled up, and your content is padded with spaces&lt;/strong>. It seems as if Oracle has given us a 3 character column with theÂ WE8ISO8859P1 character set in aÂ AL32UTF8 database, but I did not do tests to prove this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oracle decided to handle the datatypes differently depending on how you defined it's length. Although I find that very obscure, the only difference in behaviour I would expect is that if I define size in bytes, it should stay that size in bytes in the new character set, because I was &amp;quot;planning to store bytes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So defining the size of character-based types in characters results in predictable behaviour. Defining the size of character-based types in bytes makes Oracle go &lt;a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/loopy">loopy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion:&lt;/strong>
Stay clear of the CHAR datatype, unless you really have to. If you want to use the CHAR type, make sure you always specify the size in characters, not in bytes. Not only will it prevent you from having this problem, it will also make your database scripts more concise and readable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_P.S.
Make sure you clean up both databases and the link:
_&lt;em>drop table bar;
drop database link foo_link;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>And on the remote database
__ drop table foo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replace your mousecable</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/11/04/replace-your-mousecable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2008 23:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/11/04/replace-your-mousecable/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img_0513.jpg" alt="">
I recently tried to purchase a Logitech LS1 mouse from Logitech. After not hearing from them for 3 weeks, I ordered the same mouse at Dynabyte and got it within 5 days. Suddenly Logitech woke up and sent me another LS1 mouse. Because they don't react to mails or calls, I had a spare LS1 to play around with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to replace the long, rigid cable with a short supple one. Here's how you can do that, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![](img_0511.jpg?w=59)
&lt;p>](img_0511.jpg)Logitech makes mice, and sometimes nice ones. The trouble is that most mice are for PC users, who have their PC sitting on the floor, far away from the desk. So mouse cables are long, too. Logitech likes to use very ridgid cables for their mice, which sometimes means that the cable will actually have so much &amp;quot;spring&amp;quot; that it will push your mouse back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally I'm behind a laptop, so my mousecable can easily be as short as 30cm, and has to be as supple as the wires on your original iPod headphones. Luck has it, that you can actually change the cable on the Logitech LS1 mouse quite easily, with some patience and a soldering iron.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [![](img_0517.jpg?w=110)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](img_0517.jpg)RemoveÂ the slidepad-stickers to reveal 3 little black screws at the bottom.
2. Open up the mouse.
3. Unplug the white plug and remove the mousecable. The colors on my model were wired &lt;a href="http://pinouts.ru/Slots/USB_pinout.shtml">according to the USB standard&lt;/a>. The leftmost black connects to the housing, the second black is GND, red is VCC, white is D- and green is D+. Â 
4. Re-use the old plug to solder your own cable onto. I used a very thin mousecable of a very cheap mouse I had lying around, but you can use any supple USB cable you like as long as you get the connections right.
5. &lt;a href="img_0519.jpg">&lt;img src="img_0519.jpg?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a>Plug the new cable back in, and use a little tie-wrap to keep the cable in place in case you pull it.
6. Put it all back together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the observant reader: No, I did not connect the outer housing to ground, you studied the pictures very well. The new cable only had 4 leads. But given the shorter cable, it works fine without interference.Â &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_05241.jpg">&lt;img src="img_05241.jpg?w=300" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally the mouse with the old and the new cable. See the difference? The old cable almost looks like a sewer pipe compared to the new thinner cable.Â &lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you'll excuse me, I'm going to replace the other LS1 mouse with a white USB cable to match my mac :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and don't order your Logitech mouse directly from Logitech, their webshop is crappy, and their customer support is impossible to reach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Congratulations, Lewis!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/11/02/congratulations-lewis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2008 19:11:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/11/02/congratulations-lewis/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>After just missing the title last year, it looked like you were going to just miss it this year, too. The race in Brazil was very thrilling to watch, and in the last few corners of the very last lap were very exiting to watch, especially just getting Glock in the last corner. Nice race, good show. Find somebody to sell the movierights to ;-) . I'm looking forward to seeing you race again next year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_0003.png">&lt;img src="img_0003.png?w=200" alt="">
&lt;/a>As you've noticed, I bought an &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/10/11/the-iphone-buying-experience/">iPhone&lt;/a>. When you're living in the Netherlands, you've got two options to get an iPhone. The first one is walk to an Apple reseller, buy an iPhone and sell your soul to T-Mobile. The second option is to drive to Belgium, convince a reseller to sell you a simlock-free iPhone, and get a &lt;a href="http://www.vodafone.nl/prive/favorieten/Super_SIM_Only">Vodafone iPhone &amp;quot;Super Sim Only&amp;quot; contract&lt;/a>. I went for the first option, and to be honest I kind of regret it. The iPhone is brilliant, but the T-Mobile network in the Netherlands sucks. Bigtime.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your life depends on somebodies availabilty, please make sure to check they're not using the T-Mobile or Orange network (the companies merged).Â Don't let T-Mobile fool you with the &amp;quot;iPhone has bad reception hype&amp;quot;.Â I can make screenshots like you see here each day. I have &amp;quot;No service&amp;quot; but I can see the Vodafone and KPN networks just fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Although the [GSM coverage maps for T-Mobile](http://www.gsmworld.com/cgi-bin/ni_map.pl?x=0&amp;y=0&amp;z=0&amp;cc=nl&amp;net=t3) indicate that the gsm1800 coverage very good, a lot of customers, including me, will tell you otherwise from personal experience. I think the 3G coverage on the map is also unrealistic to say the least.
&lt;p>Here's a short list of locations I went to the last couple of weeks. Please note that in all of these locations, I could reliably see the Vodafone network, inside and outside.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Terrible right? In Amersfoort, Amsterdam, Haaksbergen and Leusden I actually had to walk outside to make calls, or to see if I had missed any.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really hope that this will improve significantly, otherwise I have to try to unlock my iPone and buy a Vodafone simcard. T-Mobile will then probably hold my phonenumber hostage until the end of my contract just because they can. I've had the same phonenumber for the past 15 odd years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you've got a choice, try to get an iPhone from Belgium, and avoid T-Mobile because you will be frustrated by the lack of connectivity. The only thing you'll miss is the Visual Voicemail, but if your network is good, you don't need voicemail all that much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, I'm going to check if my hart surgeon uses the T-Mobile network. If so, I need to switch to a smarter surgeon ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Design by Management</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/29/design-by-management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2008 23:00:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/29/design-by-management/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A lot of great ideas start in the heads of creative minds. Unbound by budgets, planning, and customers, these ideas are passed around, and some of them turn into projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As soon as companies and managers get involved in realizing great ideas which are not really theirs, things can go very wrong. The least that can happen is that something isn't built. Tomtom on an iPhone? A brilliant idea and &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSB46553120080609">technically possible&lt;/a>, but &lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2008/06/11/latest-iphone-sdk-agreement-limits-gps-software-capabilities">non-technical people get in the way&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->What's maybe worse is that something actually does happen. Adding "mail document" to Ms Word for instance. Or putting a Calendar application in the dashboard of a Prius. This we call ["feature creap"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep) or ["scope creep"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep). When features are added not because the customer wants them, but because management thinks they can charge for it.
&lt;p>Another thing that can happen is that as carefully designed product is rolled out, which suddenly picks up sales. Now that it's a succes, the design is pulled from the people that had the original idea, and some manager decides to make it &amp;quot;better&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And then there are the managers that understand to leave things alone. Don't hold your breath, these managers have another trick to ruin things: time pressure. Leaning on people and putting constraints on things effectively makes them no worse than the manager who decided to &amp;quot;make it better&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Becomming a manager may mean getting a better salary and a nice office, but statistically you have a bigger chance of being clueless while telling others how to do their jobs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of this is happening because there are people on the &amp;quot;workfloor&amp;quot; who think that the way &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; is &amp;quot;management&amp;quot; without realizing that managing is actually a profession you should learn, or like I always like to say, &amp;quot;be&amp;quot;. There is a fine line between learning a trade and intuitively being a craftsman which people almost never get to cross.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good team can perform with a lousy manager, and the other way around. So why is it that the manager is always the guy with the bigger salary?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse there are people who do not fit this whole story, but they're probably typing flames in the box below this article which I will then have to delete with a smile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think that a lot of this &amp;quot;you need a career&amp;quot; sillyness will go if we start paying people what they're worth, and stop paying huge amounts of money to those who clearly do not deserve it. You can start today by asking yourself if you want to earn more money, or do you really want to become a manager, even if it pays less?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe finaly the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor">janitor&lt;/a> will get payed a proper salary, maybe even more than that lousy boss of his who works 3 hours a day on a desk grunting at his staff. I wouldn't mind if our janitor made more money than I do. He works hard for it, he deserves to make a good living.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>You are a pirate!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/25/you-are-a-pirate/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2008 23:00:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/25/you-are-a-pirate/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Just to get this out of my system, I'll tell you what I think of the current crisis in the monetary system. It starts off with a fictional story, and explains why we need to get rid of the monetary system, and &lt;a href="http://www.contrarianprofits.com/articles/physical-gold-is-the-only-real-sanctuary-from-inflation/5661">why you should have physical gold&lt;/a> in your safe.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Suppose I have a nice big bar of gold, sitting in my very safe personal walk-in vault (hey it's my fantasy). I can't do much with a bar of gold so I decide to sell it to you for a thousand dollars. I suppose you don't have a cool walk-in vault, so I offer to keep it in the vault for you. You leave with a certificate.
&lt;p>The money is safely stored together with the gold. Suppose my neighbour also wants to buy a bar of gold. I show him the one in my vault and sell him that same bar of gold. Nobody will know, the bar is in my safe, and both owners can come to see it without knowing they're not the sole owner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything looks okay, but what I've done (except for the plain fraud) is devaluate your dollars, compared to the gold bar which is still in my vault. By now you should probably have noticed that I'm a bank.Â &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because nobody can check what I'm doing in my safe, I can keep this up for quite a while. With all the money, I can loan money to people, and charge interest. Now I'm creating more money from money which wasn't real to begin with. When people loan money for their houses, I effectively own their houses because the money they lent from me is not real.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can go on and on, reselling fake dollars on stock markets and so on.Â Now suppose somebody defaults on his morgage. Â By now I am entangled in my own web of money-shoving, so I have to sell that house to be able to pay my debts to other people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, the system collapses and people will partly start seeing what I've done. Because everybody now depends on my created system, it can not be undone without hurting people.Â So the governement steps in and keeps my little system in place, and even gives me a big bonus for doing god knows what.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Looks familiar? I personally think that pumping money in our defective system is not going to help in the long run. The system is not based on real value, it's based on pumping around money, and devaluating it in the process by adding more virtual, non existent money. All people involved in keeping this system alive for their own benefit should be severely punished for knowingly tweaking the system for their personal gain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, the ING stock dropped 27 points. Our &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; Dutch governement pumped a large sum of money into the bank. Now, the stock is 20 points back up. Guess who profited from that? Exactly, stock brokers who thankfully used the governement-provided tip. While it is illegal to have trading tips, this one actually is provided by the governement itself. Nice huh?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our tax money is going to the wrong people, no matter what we do because we're at the wrong end of the crooked system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a morgage at the ING for our small but way too expensive apartment, and I still think that our governement should not have done this. We should round up the people who actually think this is a good system, and punish them by at least moving them to the wrong end of the stick, where we are. Get their money and use it to undo at least some of the damage they did to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes, it will hurt. We will have to start over. But guess what? If done right, it will be equally hard for everybody. It may look like your house drops in value, but what actually happens is that the true value of your currency goes up. If I'm not mistaken that's what people usually want for their countries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes, it will have to be done globally. Although it may have started in America, the concept of the monetary system is a worldwide problem. Look at that bank in Iceland.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The new monetary system will probably also be based on gold, because we can't come up with somehing better than that. So what you want to do is &lt;a href="http://www.bullionvault.com/">get gold&lt;/a>. But not on paper. Actual, physical gold, preferably not as jewelry, because that's usually impure and harder to sell because it's value is not always measured in weight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But what we really need to do the most, is take all (yes, ALL) the money, cars and houses from people who take our money, devaluate our houses, and get a large Christmas bonus for it. Everybody complains about it, but nobody does it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting a high Google Quality Score.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/19/how-to-score-with-google/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2008 19:56:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/19/how-to-score-with-google/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="askdave-greenarticle.png">&lt;/a>The past week, I've heard some collegues talking about tweaking websites so that they will show up in Google search results. A lot of people actually try to figure out how to &amp;quot;fool&amp;quot; the Google search engine, and actually make a living writing books about it. The strange thing is, that a lot of people want to be the&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Tapestry+OGNL+adaptor+for+class"> &amp;quot;I feel lucky&amp;quot;&lt;/a> link in Google even when the search query hasn't got anything to do with the content they're providing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's actually a funny discussion, because this behaviour which &amp;quot;makes use&amp;quot; of the system, actually breaks it. Suppose a lot of people figure out how to get this done. Now, whenever you use Google, your first page of search results will actually contain stuff you're not looking for. After a few tries, you'll get tired of this and start using a different search engine.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->It's almost like today's monetary and financial systems, where somebody figures out a way to make money in a dubious way and knowing it. In the end, we know what will happen, but that's a whole different subject (keep posted ;-) ).
&lt;p>For some search terms, this site (yes, rolfje.com) is actually &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=replace+headlights+xsara">on the first page&lt;/a>, and sometimes even the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=lost+oracle+password">&amp;quot;I feel lucky&amp;quot;&lt;/a>Â (I wonder for how long). Why? Well, because the good news is that at Google, there are a lot of smart people working on tweaking the search algorithms each day, to prevent people from succesfully creating &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bomb">Google bombs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other very important reason is that when Google &amp;quot;crawls&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;spiders&amp;quot; this site, the content it's going to find is real, readable and honest. There are no &amp;quot;hidden fields&amp;quot; in the article which act as spider magnets. When somebody finds this site and likes it, chances are very high that they're going to link to the content. For Google, that's bonus points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So how do I do that? By doing the following 4 important things:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>1) Do not try to influence Google&lt;/strong>
By adding false content like hidden search terms, malicious &lt;a href="http://www.developer-resource.com/spider-food.htm">spider food&lt;/a>, and paying people to link to your site, you may end up high on any search. The trouble with that is that you are not reaching your intended audience (they were looking for something else). By showing up again and again on the first page, people will develop &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_blindness">&amp;quot;ad blindness&amp;quot;&lt;/a> for your site name. This means they will never, ever click on anything which looks like your URL because you've &amp;quot;betrayed&amp;quot; them before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2) Educate people, educate Google&lt;/strong>
Did you ever have that problem that you were searching for an answer on Google, but all you found were other people with the same question you had? And when you found the answer, did you blog about it? No? Too bad, that was the absolute chance of getting an &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=tomcat+utf8+requestdumpervalve">&amp;quot;I feel lucky&amp;quot;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3) Put some effort in your posts&lt;/strong>
I can't count the number of times when I found what seemed to be the answer to my question, but the page was hard to read, incomplete or plain wrong. If you want to be the &amp;quot;go-to site&amp;quot; for answers, write them as clear, consise, and complete as possible without using to much &amp;quot;fluff&amp;quot; or intelligent words. People will love you for it, and link to your posts. You can even re-use your own material by pointing to it when somebody asks you a question which you know your blog has the answer to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4) Layout!
The attention span of surfers is short. It's often measured in seconds, or in mouse clicks. To keep somebody on your site, you'd better come up with an easy to read article which contains at least a hint of providing a solution in the first sentence of the post. Having too much blinking ads, colorful layout or a small font will distract from the content, and people will leave early. This is caused byÂ &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/banner-blindness.html">banner-blindness&amp;quot;&lt;/a>.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="askdave-greenarticle.png">&lt;img src="askdave-greenarticle.png?w=97" alt="">
&lt;/a>Here's a good example. I've made a screen shot of an &lt;a href="http://www.askdavetaylor.com/">&amp;quot;askdavetaylor&amp;quot;&lt;/a> article. Dave writes nice articles with answers to simple everyday Mac OSX related questions. Every now and then, Dave shows up in my Google searches, but not nearly as much as he could. Why? He violates rule 1 and 4. The page contains all kinds of words and links which have nothing to do with the actual content, and the layout is terrible. On the right, you see a screenshot of Dave's site, where I marked the actual content with a green color. Do you see how hard this must be to read? The article actually squeezes between some unrelated links and a very large Google ad.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="rolfje-greenarticle.png">&lt;img src="rolfje-greenarticle.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>As a comparison, I did the same withÂ this blog. See the difference? The actual content is much closer to the top of the browser, and most of the time the answer can be found in the first few sentences. There is less distraction and less scrolling. Even if there is some scrolling involved, there are no terrible &amp;quot;next page&amp;quot; links to read further. &amp;quot;next page&amp;quot; links mean the article can not be printed, and it takes an extra amount of time reloading all the ads when I want to continue reading. Half of your audience is gone at the second mouseclick, and will never return (including their first click on the &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=java+5+bigdecimal+oracle">&amp;quot;I feel lucky&amp;quot;&lt;/a> button).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're still reading at this point, your attention span is longer than the average reader. Congratulations. It also means that you care enough about this stuff to apply to your own site. So I'll stop typing and let you to it. Remember: Focus, and try to be honest and to the point.

&lt;p>Ok so I've been &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/apple-reinvents-phone-ipod-and-userinterface-in-1-go/">blogging about&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/01/13/see-the-iphone-demo/">the iPhone&lt;/a> and&lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/cowbell/"> it's &amp;quot;apps&amp;quot;&lt;/a> for a while now. After a lot of consideration and switching between Nokia and iPod touch, doing nothing and buying a 16GB 3G iPhone, I finally went for the latter. What a bittersweet experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->We have no real Apple stores. They're called "Apple authorized resellers" and may look like an Apple store, but they're not. Because they are run by slow Dutch people (I get to that in a minute), and don't have geniuous bars, and can't seem to be of help unless you want to buy something.
&lt;p>In the Netherlands, you can by an iPhone at T-mobile shops, or at the Apple store. At the T-Mobile stores, there are often no iPhones in stock. At the Apple stores (let's call 'em that, to humor them) the employees know nothing of cellphone contracts. Because I like the interiour of the Apple store better, I decided to get my iPhone there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went for the black 16GB 3G model, because the white one is just a bit to &amp;quot;girly&amp;quot;, and is easy to spot 100 miles away for any bad guys out to steal iPhones.Â I came prepared with copies of my passport and old SIM card.Â The guy behind the counter went into the storage room to get one. Then something strange happened: a &lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels&lt;/a> session was started up, and an Internet Explorer browser opened to show a HTTPS page at which we could fill in a contract form. It took ages to start up, and the T-Mobile &amp;quot;special registration form&amp;quot; was teribly slow. The Apple salesman was not very fast either, I had to correct him more than once because he didn't read the instruction on the screen. All in all I spent 37 minutes (measured) in the store to get everything registered and payed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I am still wondering why the T-Mobile registration page could not have been opened in Firefox or Safari on OSX.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a week, T-mobile sent a letter saying that my old number could not be ported. I called customer support and as it turned out, the guy at the Apple store still didn't fill in the form correctly (I wonder what he missed after staring at 2 html forms for 37 minutes). After being on hold for over 28 minutes at the T-Mobile helpdesk, they solved everything and my original number got transfered within 3 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here I am, with an iPhone. Prepare to read a lot about it. ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Three Great Virtues of a Programmer</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/05/the-three-great-virtues-of-a-programmer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Oct 2008 11:02:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/10/05/the-three-great-virtues-of-a-programmer/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I ran across &lt;a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris">this wiki page&lt;/a> which has a nice piece on the virtues of a good programmer. I found it so recognizable that I decided to copy it over for you to enjoy:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>_**"We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris."**_** **-- Larry Wall, Programming Perl (1st edition), O'Reilly and Associates
&lt;p>**Laziness
**The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer. Also hence, this book. See also impatience and hubris. (p.609)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Impatience
**The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and hubris. (p.608)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Hubris
**Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer. See also laziness and impatience. (p.607)&lt;/blockquote>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As I explained earlier, I think it is really important to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/07/12/conform-specs-is-not-enough/">go beyond the specs&lt;/a>. It's really important to put care and attention in your product. The new version of iTunes has a great (little) example of what I mean. I use Itunes to play music through both the computer speakers and a stereo in the livingroom, connected to an Airport Express.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In iTunes 7, when I added the Airport Express to the set of outputs while playing a song, the music stopped, and after a while resumed playing through all the selected outputs. I never minded the short silence, and was amazed at how Apple got all the outputs to play perfectly in sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In iTunes 8 things changed a tiny bit. When I select the Airport Express, the music keeps on playing on my computer, and after a few seconds the music also starts playing from the speakers in the living room. An still, the music is in sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's these little things, the amazing attention to detail, that give Apple products a tremendous &amp;quot;perceived value&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That, and the Genius button ofcourse. :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Bigger Time Machine without Changing History</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2008 20:31:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I had a 160GB drive holding my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/backup-guru-give-me-a-break/">Time Machine backups&lt;/a>. Because I wanted to backup external disks, and still wanted to be able to travel about a year back in time, I bought a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/osx-format-1tb-usb-drive/">1TB USB disk&lt;/a>. Stephen Foskett wrote a &lt;a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2008/07/26/how-to-move-os-x-time-machine-backups-to-a-new-disk/">great article&lt;/a> about how he migrated his TimeMachine backup to a larger disk, but it's lengthy and misses one essential step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to give you the short version, this blog post describes how I migrated Time Machine to the new disk without losing any data in 11 easy steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Get a new, big, empty drive with a single Mac Journaled partition on it. Give it a good name so you can keep it apart from the original Time Machine drive.
2. Open the Time Machine configuration screen, and turn off Time Machine.
3. Unmount and remount the Time Machine drive, it should show up as an ordinary orange drive on your desktop.
4. Open Disk Utility, and click the &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot; Tab.
5. [![](copy-timemachine-drive.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](copy-timemachine-drive.png)Drag the &amp;quot;TimeMachine&amp;quot; partition which is on the old drive to the &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; box.
6. Drag the large partition on the new drive to the &amp;quot;Target&amp;quot; box.
7. Select &amp;quot;Erase Target&amp;quot;. If you do not check this, the disc copy will fail. This is the essential step I mentioned earlier.
8. Click &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot;, double check the popup warning to see if you are doing the right thing and press &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot; again. After a number of hours, depending on the speed of your USB hub and the size of the disks, you will see 2 identical drives on your desktop. The new drive should have a lot more space available. In my case, it took 5 hours to migrate 160GB to the new drive.
9. Unmount the old Time Machine drive, physically disconnect it to be sure.
10. Open the Time Machine configuration screen, and turn on Time Machine.
11. In the Time Machine configuration screen, press &amp;quot;Change drive&amp;quot; and select the new drive. You will see the disk icon turn into the green TimeMachine drive icon. You're done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can test Time Machine now by clicking the Time Machine icon in your dock and see that you still have all your history. Once you've verified that all your history is still there, you can use your old Time Machine drive for something else (reformat it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might also want to check your spotlight settings to not include your Time Machine drive for searching. Because I did not touch the volume name on the new drive, I didn't have to change any settings, but I checked to be sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus tip:&lt;/strong>
Now that you've got a large backup drive, maybe it's time to think about backing up your external drives. Make sure all the drives you want to backup are connected, and open the Time Machine configuration screen. Click on &amp;quot;Options...&amp;quot; and remove the drives you want to back up from that list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSX: Formatting a 1TB USB Drive</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/09/07/osx-format-1tb-usb-drive/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2008 11:50:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/09/07/osx-format-1tb-usb-drive/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I just bought a Maxtor Basics 1TB drive, and found that I could not seem to format it using the Leopard Diskutility. Then, I found &lt;a href="http://en.kioskea.net/forum/affich-4848-wd-my-book-formattin">this page&lt;/a> which contained the golden tip. I'll save you some reading:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open Apple's Disk Utility
2. Click on the drive (not the partition in it, if there is any), and select &amp;quot;Partitioning&amp;quot;.
3. Select &amp;quot;1 partition&amp;quot; and then press &amp;quot;Options&amp;quot;.
4. You'll see that &amp;quot;MBR&amp;quot; is the default, which is what's causing the problem. Select the middle option &amp;quot;Apple Partition&amp;quot; and you're good to go.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>In Windows, there is a great tool called &lt;a href="http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/">&amp;quot;PureText&amp;quot;&lt;/a> which sits in your tray, and can remove formatting from copy/paste actions if you want to. In stead of pasting into notepad, and then copying it again, you now can use the Windows-V combination to paste without formatting. It works in any program, and I'm a fond user of this little gem at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In OSX, you can do this with a key combination, Option-Shift-Command-V. Besides being the silliest and most awkward key combination ever to do a simple paste-action, it does not always do the job properly. I found this &lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/simx/technonova/C488455530/E20071125225334/index.html">great tip&lt;/a> where a simple applescript removes formatting from the items in your clipboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->If you don't know how to save this script, do the following:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open the Apple Script Editor (use Spotlight if you don't know where to look for it)
2. In the editor window, paste the following text:set the clipboard to Â«class ktxtÂ» of ((the clipboard as text) as record)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>beep
3. Click &amp;quot;Compile&amp;quot; and then select &amp;quot;Archive -&amp;gt; Save As...&amp;quot;
4. Save the script as an application (anywhere you think is appropriate)
5. Drag the resulting app into your dock to have it handy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It looks like a lot of work, but these are the absoluut smallest steps I can help you with. It's really simple. When you're done, select any text you want to copy, and press Command-C to copy it. Then, before pasting, start the app you just made. You'll here the system beep indicating that it's ready. Now you can use Command-V and presto, plain text, no formatting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use this a lot to copy text from mails and documents into my Evernote, and it works fine. The only small irritation is the extra mouseclick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Weekend of Crashes</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/31/a-weekend-of-crashes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Aug 2008 20:31:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/31/a-weekend-of-crashes/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>This weekend was a lot of fun. Saturday night I got to fly Leo's Walkera 60B electric helicopter. That's one piece of impressive (and scary) machinery. Although it feels easier to fly than my 4#3B, I still &amp;quot;managed&amp;quot; to crash it. Luckaly the blades can be easily replaced, and after tightening a bunch of screws and replacing a pin in the main gear, it was good to fly again. We flew 3 times, and had to repair the helicopter after each flight :-) I hope I can treat you with good shots of the Walkera 60B next time, there are not many high-quality images of it online.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/photo/3413033">&lt;!-- more -->&lt;img src="http://www.23hq.com/23666/3413033_ea62d55e9fd2d7bf2b3876f1780455d0_mblog.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>After getting the hang of the big 60B, I got home and did some flying with my little &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/new-helicopter-to-master/">Walkera 4#3B&lt;/a>. I can now seem to hover it slightly longer than last week, but I still &amp;quot;landed&amp;quot; the thing in the strangest places. Normally there's not much damage, but this time I broke the tail rotor axle. In the pictures, you can also see the crack in the canopy which I simply repaired with a piece of tape. After I repaired the tailrotor, I crashed it again, this time breaking the rear tail altogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third crash this weekend was not mine, but &lt;a href="http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/08content/motogp/ducati/gb/motogp-fri-stoner-quickest-641.jpg">Kacey Stoner&lt;/a>'s. In the MotoGP race at Misano, Rossi almost high-sided in the first lap, and that little mistake made the gap with Stoner about 3 seconds. As Rossi was trying to gain, Stoner went down in the hairpin in the 8th lap. I sure would have liked to see Rossi and Stoner battle for the win. All in all &lt;a href="http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2008/Rossi+takes+home+victory+and+75+point+advantage+at+Misano">it was a nice race&lt;/a>, won by Valentino Rossi.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mine are real.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/27/mine-are-real/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2008 20:15:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/27/mine-are-real/</guid><description>
&lt;p>As &lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/08/the-first-law-o.html">Seth Godin pointed out&lt;/a>,Â &lt;em>&amp;quot;Organizations will work tirelessly to de-personalize every communication medium they encounter.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just to let you know, all my mail is hand typed, including the _&amp;quot;Kind Regards&amp;quot; _and my name at the end. You may find it silly, but I think it shows that you care. I always think about my greetings, and I even try to vary them every now and then. Having a default greeting underneath every mail, wether the content of that mail requires it or not is just plain silly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Almost just as &lt;a href="http://www.goldmark.org/jeff/stupid-disclaimers/">silly as the disclaimers&lt;/a> people put in the mail, thinking that it has any legal value, or even thinking somebody actually reads those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next time you receive a mail from me, keep in mind that my greetings are actual, meaningful, honest greetings, personally written from me to you. You may have noticed that I am never &lt;em>&amp;quot;yours&amp;quot;&lt;/em>, because then I would be &lt;em>&amp;quot;truly&amp;quot;&lt;/em> lying.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes, it als gives me an opportunity to leave them out, or tone them down. You're allowed to check your mail now.

&lt;p>My wife has this great Macbook Pro 15&amp;quot;, and I &amp;quot;don't mind&amp;quot; using it every now and then. I noticed that when running on batteries, screen updates are a bit strange:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * When scrolling down a webpage, the page get garbled. Scrolling the garbled piece out of the window and in again sometimes fixes it.
* When resizing a Finder window, the icons in the window flicker a lot, you can see them being cleared and redrawn.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I noticed more people having these problems on several forums, and I also read that resetting the PRAM could fix it. Well, I just reset the PRAM and it seems to have fixed it, indeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used the method mentioned on &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379">Apple's support page&lt;/a>, which tells you to shut the computer down, and boot it up holding the command, option, P and R keys.

&lt;p>For those of you who think that media and information are free and uncontroled, guess again. Lately I have been seeing more and more incidents of large corporations hiding information, and even telling other people to hide it for them. I think this is plain wrong, and the guys involved should have been fired or punished otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have information which is of interest to the public, and somebody is making you sign a paper with which he can force you to shut up, you should think twice (and then not do it). Not because of the money, not because of the information itself, but for the sheer principle. Information should not be controled in that way. By anyone. It is dangerous.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When do these people realize that witholding information is only postponing the inevitable fact that people are going to hear about the stuff they are trying to hide? Are they really thinking that people all over the world, connected in all kinds of different ways, aren't going to notice what you are doing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse, they are doing a pretty darn good job so far, but it will break down eventually.

&lt;/a>A friend of mine and me ordered 2 Walkera 4#3B electric model helicopters 3 weeks ago. Last frinday, they finally arrived, and this weekend we had some good fun flying them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think flying a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/helicopter-fun/">PicooZ&lt;/a> is hard, don't even start thinking about one of these. It looks easier on the &lt;a href="http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=VbvD4OYOqt8">youtube video's&lt;/a> than it seems. I have some experience with RC models (mainly cars and boats), but flying this helicopter is really hard.

&lt;p>My &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/homezone-start-isync-automatically/">Nokia 6300&lt;/a> behaves like a flash or thumb drive when I connect it to a computer using an USB cable. I think this should be standard functionality nowadays. Cellphones are replacing the Filofax and MP3 players. I can read mail on my cellphone, take pictures and movies. It contains an 4GB memory stick, sometimes even more. So why do I need to carry this silly thumbdrive with me?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->If you have an iPhone with the 2.0 firmware, unlimited dataplan, and maybe even [MobileMe](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/), you may already have found a solution for carrying all kinds of data with you. If you haven't, maybe [DataCase](http://www.veiosoft.com/) is something for you. It will allow you to turn your iPhone into a (network) drive and put stuff on there to take with you.
&lt;p>Please note that at the time of this writing, DataCase is in closed Beta testing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cowbell++;</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/07/cowbell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Aug 2008 06:00:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/07/cowbell/</guid><description>

&lt;p>In this strange world, people can't seem to leave your stuff alone. All the electronic gadgets of today are too attractive to the lowlife of this world. So what do you do if somebody swipes your laptop? You take a few pictures of him, and trace his IP address!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->This kind of software has been around for a while, and a few companies have made good money of of it. The closed source solutions are also feeding information to those companies when you don't want it to, and you're also not sure what information is send to the company.
&lt;p>There is now a solution for the more paranoid geeks amongst us. It's called &lt;a href="http://adeona.cs.washington.edu/index.html">&amp;quot;Adeona&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, and it is the first Open Source system for tracking the location of your lost or stolen laptop. The software does not rely on a proprietary and/or central service, and is entirely free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What's also nice is that only the owner (that's you) can access the machine should you want to trace it. If you don't trust me, and don't trust Adeona, you can always check the sourcecode yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A laptop is the most logical target of the casual thief, so it makes sence to install it on there. A casual thief is usually not tech savvy, so before he discoveres that Adeona (or any other similar program) you will have usually traced him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Burglars also tend to take your desktop machine, so you might aswel install Adeona on there, too. And since Adeona comes as an OSX, Linux and Windows program, most of the computers out there will be covered.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;figure class="float_left">&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark">&lt;img src="no-exclamation.png" width="80"/>&lt;/a>
&lt;/figure>
Some developers nowadays still think that putting an exclamation mark in their log entries adds to the visibility of their entry. When other developers notice this, they will add even more exclamation marks so their log entries are even more visible. I compiled a few examples of bad log entries and some pointers for you to improve your log entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>In my current project, I've seen log lines like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">Logger&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">warn&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;No null allowed here !!!&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">);&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Or the &amp;quot;I really stand out&amp;quot; tricks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">Logger&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">debug&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt;-&amp;gt; Reached this line !&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">);&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Writing log entries like this really show your inability to use your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment">IDE&lt;/a>Â for setting breakpoints and stepping through code, Â while also showing your poor comunication skills. If I encounter these kind of log entries, I try to see if I can improve them, and/or adjust their level. Here are some pointers I use for writing log entries:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Be informative.&lt;/strong> Try to include all information in the log entry which could help the reader determine the reason or cause for this log entry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Use full sentences.&lt;/strong> Write your log entries like a novel. It will make them easier to read, and will also allow system administrators to litteraly copy/paste the text into a mail when sharing information about problem analysis. They will thank you for it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refrain from using &amp;quot;search strings&amp;quot;.&lt;/strong> Lots of stars, dashes or quotes do not improve readability of the log file, and it will make it look unprofessional. Searching for a bunch of stars is just as fast as searching for a word, given the right tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Don't overdo it.&lt;/strong> Try to have at most 1 log statement per method. Don't spoil it on trivial information, it will devaluate the rest of the entries in the logfile.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using these guidelines, the log entries I showed you could be rewritten as:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">Logger&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">warn&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span> &lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;The method &amp;#39;storeUser&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t accept &amp;#39;null&amp;#39; as it&amp;#39;s parameter.&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">);&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>and&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-java" data-lang="java">&lt;span class="ln">1&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">Logger&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">debug&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">(&lt;/span>
&lt;span class="ln">2&lt;/span> &lt;span class="s">&amp;#34;The user with id &amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">+&lt;/span>&lt;span class="n">user&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">.&lt;/span>&lt;span class="na">getId&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">()+&lt;/span>&lt;span class="s">&amp;#34; was stored in the database.&amp;#34;&lt;/span>&lt;span class="o">);&lt;/span>
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>Comparing these new versions with the earlier examples, I think you will find that there is much more information in these, and you can now even guess that these entries are from a storage method in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Access_Object">DAO&lt;/a>Â for storing users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another important thing to think about when writing log entries is the level at which you log. For Log4J log messages, I use the following definitions to choose log levels:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>FATAL&lt;/strong> - The system has encountered such a severe error that it needs to shut down completely. No user can access the system after this log message. &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_dump">Core dump&lt;/a>&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_%28computing%29">Crash&lt;/a>&amp;quot; come to mind.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ERROR&lt;/strong> - A serious error prevented the action from completing. Although the application is still running, the user session is probably terminated or in an awkward state. Examples of ERROR are temporarily inaccessable databases or remote systems which prevent the current action from completing succesfuly. A few error messages should be enough to call second level support in the middle of the night.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>WARN&lt;/strong> - The user session is still usable, and the system encountered an abnormality which should possibly be analyzed by a system administrator or level 1 support guy to see if corrective actions need to be planned.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>INFO&lt;/strong> - Info to the system administrator about interesting events. These events are &amp;quot;The application started up and is now ready for use&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;The application will use server XYZ for database access&amp;quot;. Informative or confirmative messages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>DEBUG&lt;/strong> - Everything else. Stuff you don't really need to see in a production environment. In some rare cases, you can set the visibility of the log levels to &amp;quot;debug&amp;quot; in a production environment if you have a really strange problem and are willing to sacrifice some system speed and storage to analyze. System administrators will (should) not want to see this information.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The last tip I am going to give you, which does not only apply to coding, but also writing mails and documentation in general:&lt;/p>
&lt;center>&lt;br/>&lt;span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.5rem;">Never, ever use exclamation marks in professional texts!&lt;/span>&lt;br/>&lt;br/>&lt;/center>
&lt;p>Exclamation marks are a poor mans way of expressing the inability to indicate the importance of a sentence, while at the same time insulting the reader. Why do you assume that the reader does not get the importance of your words?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you ever wonder why I didn't answer your mail immediately, see if there are exclamation marks in there. And no, adding some will not help.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Process</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/01/the-process/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Aug 2008 13:55:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/08/01/the-process/</guid><description>

&lt;p>When using POI in any of your projects, and the application you're building is a web application, you probably have it running on a Windows machine. If not, you know all about the struggle with the &lt;a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/headless/">&amp;quot;headless mode&amp;quot;&lt;/a> environment setting to tell the JVM how to handle graphics rendering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I always like to keep my applications as clean as possible to the users. The system administrator is also a user of the software (during installation at least). So I wanted the application to set the environment properties itself, In this case, I built a nice little Spring bean to handle this. The solution is so simple, that it is almost a brilliant display of what Spring can solve for you. Suddenly, all these environment setting problems turned into a simple Spring configuration problem. Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->In the Spring configuration, the whole "headless mode" problem got reduced to this bean definition:
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;bean id=&amp;quot;systemproperty_initializer&amp;quot;Â 
Â Â  class=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.SystemPropertyInitiliazingBean&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
Â Â  &amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;systemProperties&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
Â  Â  Â  &amp;lt;map&amp;gt;
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  &amp;lt;!-- Set headless mode to true,Â 
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  for POI sheet.autoSizeColumn SeeÂ 
&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;http://poi.apache.org/hssf/quick-guide.html&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span&amp;gt;Â 
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  --&amp;gt;
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  &amp;lt;entry key=&amp;quot;java.awt.headless&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
Â Â  Â  &amp;lt;/map&amp;gt;
Â Â  &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The code for theÂ SystemPropertyInitilizingBean is really a simple list iterator which walks though the map and sets everything as a system property:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>/**
Â * Bean for automatically initializing SystemÂ 
Â * properties from within a Spring context.Â 
Â */
public class SystemPropertyInitializingBeanÂ 
Â Â  Â  Â  implements InitializingBean {
Â  Â  Â  Â  /** Properties to be set */
Â  Â  Â  Â  private Map systemProperties;
Â  Â  Â  Â  /** Sets the system properties */
Â  Â  Â  Â  public void afterPropertiesSet()Â 
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  throws Exception {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  if (systemProperties == null ||Â 
Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  systemProperties.isEmpty()) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  // No properties to initialize
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  return;
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  }
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Iterator i = systemProperties.keySet().iterator();
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  while (i.hasNext()) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  String key = (String) i.next();
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  String value = (String) systemProperties.get(key);
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  System.setProperty(key, value);
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  }
Â  Â  Â  Â  }
Â  Â  Â  Â  public void setSystemProperties(Map systemProperties) {
Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  this.systemProperties = systemProperties;
Â  Â  Â  Â  }
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In my opinion this is a nice and clean solution, which does not impact any of the application code, hides the setting of obscure system properties from the administrator, is simple to the developer, gives room to add comments (see Spring xml above)and is reusable. All in a few lines of code.Â You can even easily have it parese settings from a config file, and put that into system environment variables without changing a line of code. All in Spring XML.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes it's the small things that make you feel nice :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ibatis 2.2 Ignores XML encoding</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/20/ibatis-22-ignores-xml-encoding/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2008 22:37:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/20/ibatis-22-ignores-xml-encoding/</guid><description>
&lt;p>At my company, we're using Ibatis to do operations on Oracle databases. As most of our software is designed to be international, we keep our XML files in UTF-8 encoding. Recently we discovered that Ibatis had some trouble parsing the XML files when we were using diacritics in them. As it turns out, Ibatis 2.2 actually ignores the &amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot; setting in the XML file header altogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was actually reported as an &lt;a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IBATIS-349?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#action_12454071">issue&lt;/a> at apache's issue tracker, and fixed in Ibatis release 2.3 and upward. In the meantime, if you can not swich to a new release because of tight deadlines and no time for regression tests, you can set the file.encoding property to UTF-8, because then Ibatis will parse the XML in the correct encoding.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tomcat, UTF-8 and the RequestDumperValve</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/20/tomcat-utf-8-and-the-requestdumpervalve/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2008 22:30:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/20/tomcat-utf-8-and-the-requestdumpervalve/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A week ago, we encountered a funny problem where our Tapestry 3.0 application seemed to screw up the encoding of form posts. Every time we tried to post a form with diacritics in the input fields, the data got mangled before reaching the application code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As it turned out, somebody had turned on the RequestDumperValve in the Tomcat configuration file. The request dumper does not only dump the request, but is also kind enough to mangle the data before handing it over to the servlet for further processing:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;!-- more -->&amp;quot;Enabling the RequestDumperValve in both 5.5.12 and 5.0.16 (!) messes up the parsing of other-than-ISO-8859-1 incoming parameters.
After using a rather huge bunch of hours, this came down as the result: when this &amp;quot;debug valve&amp;quot; is turned on, it seems to default to ISO-8859-1 when it parses and log-outputs the incoming parameters, thus also implicitly setting the entire Request-object to this enc, so any subsequnt setting to UTF-8 doesn't matter at all. At least this is true for POST parameters.
For GET parameters, the situation is a little different. Here an explicit setting of URIEncoding to UTF-8 seems to work as it should, while useBodyEncodingForURI doesn't - it picks up the wrong already implicitly set encoding. (For 5.0.16 I can't seem to get the latter version to work, and have to use the explicit setting.)
Sorry if my analysis doesn't hold water, but at least the bug seems to be very consistent.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(quoted from a post byÂ Endre StÃ¸lsvik found in the &lt;a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/users@tomcat.apache.org/msg04008.html">mail archive&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you have strange UTF-8 problems with Tomcat, see if the following line is in your server.xml file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Â Â  &amp;lt;Valve className=&amp;quot;org.apache.catalina.valves.RequestDumperValve&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If this line is in, comment it out, restart and try again. Chances are that your problem has dissapeared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most irritating point about this whole adventure is that the RequestDumperValve was found by a collegue with which I used the RequestDumperValve a year or so ago to fix some other problem, and we already had discovered exactly this behaviour. If only I had blogged about it then... Good thing Joris' memory is better than mine :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Conform Specs is not enough</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/12/conform-specs-is-not-enough/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2008 19:13:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/12/conform-specs-is-not-enough/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Like any good software company, when a project starts, we sit down with the client, and talk about what we can do to help. The result is usually a more or less complete SRS (Software Requirement Specification). The SRS serves as input to the design fase (we usually already have an architecture sketch when the SRS is made) and those two documents are used to brief the developers and keep everybody posted on what to build. If all done correctly, this should then result in a perfect piece of software right?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Well yes and no. Recently I noticed a funny implementation of a requirement which proved to me that sometimes, people do not care enough to see what they are actually doing.
&lt;p>&lt;img src="conform-specs.png" alt="">
In this particular case, the customer wanted an authorization workflow built into a system so that administrators could aprove of a customer request. In the SRS it was clearly written that the state of the customer request should be easily visible, using traffic light icons. The developer that was responsible for this perfectly implemented the requirement, and created the traffic lights, as you can see on the right. Yes, these are exact copies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far so good right? Functionality implemented and working, no bugs, traffic lights according to specs. This was implemented 11 months ago, and the customer has not complained. He had no reason to. It was according to specs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These traffic lights are viewed by the clients employees and customers in 5 countries, about 4000 times a month. If any of these users are like me, they are probably amazed by the traffic lights. It has no hint of design in it. It was just hacked together. Look at the red traffic ligt. The red lamp is not in the middle of the black box. To me, it shows utter carelesness. The whole traffic light is 8 pixels wide. When hand-pixeling this in 800% zoom mode (which has obviously been done), the creator was so blind that he didn't take care in placing the lights in the middle of the black area. How blind can you be?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mission critical applications are expensive. So why is it that sometimes they don't &amp;quot;look-and-feel&amp;quot; expensive? Because it is all up to the developer to care about these details. Not only do you need perfectionists, you need passionate people wo actually care about what they're building and have a bad nights sleep when something is wrong with the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="good-solution.png" alt="">
I this case, I made an attempt to fix it by replacing the traffic lights with my own versions (shown at your right). To me, it is a huge difference. You may not like the design, but these lights at least show that we care. Because we do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don't just fight the specs. Beat them. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh_RGjqkJ04">&amp;quot;Swiftly, and with style.&amp;quot;&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hacking Your Way Through Codebases</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/02/hacking-your-way-through-codebases/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2008 19:12:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/07/02/hacking-your-way-through-codebases/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I found a nice blog post which describes how it is after you leave school and start programming for a real company. You discover that programming is more like 80% reading and 20% coding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read the article at the Tired Architect's blog titled &lt;a href="http://antipattern.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/hacking-your-way-through-codebases/">&amp;quot;Hacking Your Way Through Codebases&amp;quot;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrate from Windows to OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/18/migrate-from-windows-to-osx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 19:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/18/migrate-from-windows-to-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>My wife got tired of her Windows/Compaq laptop. So 2 weeks ago, she decides to go out and buy a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">15&amp;quot; macbook pro&lt;/a> (an excelent choice I might add). She was a bit worried about getting used to the new machine, but decided to take the risk. After no more than 3 days, with surprisingly little help, she figured out how to do everything she did on the Windows machine, and even installed her own software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last thing to do was to migrate all the stuff from her old Windows machine to her new &amp;quot;lappie&amp;quot; (yes, she actually gave this one a nickname :-) ). Although Microsoft tries hard to keep Outlook Express users &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">locked in&lt;/a>, I did find a tool that solved the problem completely for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Bookmarks**
&lt;p>&lt;a href="menubarcheck.jpg">&lt;img src="menubarcheck.jpg?w=77" alt="Turn on IE7 Menu Bar">
&lt;/a>This is an easy thing to do. Most browsers can export their bookmarks easily, and Safari can import them easily. There was one little thing that took some time figuring out: IE7 hides your menu bar, which prevents you from finding the &amp;quot;File -&amp;gt; Export Bookmarks...&amp;quot; option. You can turn the menubar back on by clicking on the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, and selecting &amp;quot;Menu bar&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that you've got the &amp;quot;File&amp;quot; menu in Internet Explorer, I think you can figure out the rest for yourselves. Import the resulting HTML into Safari by using the &amp;quot;Archive -&amp;gt; Import Bookmarks...&amp;quot; option and you're done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Outlook Express export
**&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="outlook-mappen.png">&lt;img src="outlook-mappen.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Outlook Express is a bit trickier. First, you need to find your mailbox files. Normally, finding files is not a big problem, but Microsoft has crippled the &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot; functionality in Explorer to such a degree that you can't actually find your mailbox files with it. So, Choose &amp;quot;Start -&amp;gt; Run...&amp;quot; and type in &amp;quot;cmd&amp;quot;. The black box you'll see is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmEvPZUdAVI">DOS Prompt&lt;/a>. Open your Outlook express and take a look at the names of your mailbox Folders. On yor filesystem, there are &amp;quot;dbx&amp;quot; files which correspond with these. For the example on the right, we can find all dbx files with the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#999999;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;C:\Documents and Settings\YourLoginName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;cd \
&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#999999;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;C:\&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;dir /s /b *.dbx
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You'll get a list of complete filenames (drive, directory and filename) of the Outlook Express dbx files found on your system. Close Outlook Express, find the corresponding files and copy them into a temporary folder for convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we've got the dbx files containing all the mail, we need to convert those into a format which can be read by Mail.app. To do that, download &lt;a href="http://freenet-homepage.de/ukrebs/english/dbxconv.html">DbxConv&lt;/a> and unzip it in the same temporary folder you just created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go back to your DOS Prompt, go into the directory where your dbx files and DbxConv are, and use the following command to convert everything into &lt;a href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html">mbox files&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#999999;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;C:\temp\&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;DbxConv *.dbx
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Take the resulting mbox files and put them on your new Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mail.app import&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-11.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-11.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Open &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html">Mail.app&lt;/a> and configure it without worrying about it getting your mail or creating mailboxes. All done? Good. Select &amp;quot;Archive -&amp;gt; Import Mailbox...&amp;quot; from the menu at the top of your screen. Select the &amp;quot;mbox&amp;quot; format, and then select all the mbox files you've just put on your Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mail.app will import all the mailboxes, and place them in a folder called &amp;quot;Imported Mailboxes&amp;quot;. In this folder, you'll find additional Folders, one per mbox file. All your mail will be in those folders, including the correct dates, attachments and even read/unread information. Drag the mails to any Folder you like, for instance the &amp;quot;Inbox&amp;quot; folder contents can be dragged to... you guessed it, your Mail.app &amp;quot;Inbox&amp;quot;. It will merge perfectly, like you've always been using Mail.app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>MSN and GoogleTalk&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're a GoogleTalk user, you can get away with &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat.html">iChat&lt;/a> , the built-in chat client in Leopard. Just &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24076">set it up&lt;/a> to use the google server and youre good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're an MSN user, you can try &lt;a href="http://www.amsn-project.net/download.php">aMSN&lt;/a>, which should look very familiar to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use both GoogleTalk and MSN, and possibly other chat clients, your best bet is to go with &lt;a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium&lt;/a>. Adium is the chat client of my choice, but it can not do audio or video, so be warned (to me this is a big plus by the way :-) ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Make a Disk Image&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to migrating your mail and bookmarks, you need to move your data to your new machine, too. There's always a chance that you forget to move stuff. So keep your old PC for another month or so, or even better: Make a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/06/06/clone-windows-hd-on-apple-osx-machine/">disk image&lt;/a> from the harddisk. You can now safely trash your PC (&lt;a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/">wipe that harddisk first&lt;/a>) without having to worry about lost data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do yourself another favour: Buy a 500GB (or bigger) harddisk, and reserve it for backups only. Hook it up to your new Mac and you'll be automagically introduced to Apple's excelent zero-setup, zero-fuss &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">TimeMachine&lt;/a>. You'll be very happy, &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/02/21/time-machine-to-the-rescue/">trust me&lt;/a>. Or &lt;a href="http://blog.bernardkowalski.com/?p=3">trust others&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun with your new computer!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WWDC 2008 Keynote video</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/10/wwdc-2008-keynote-video/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:25:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/10/wwdc-2008-keynote-video/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.png" alt="Teribly irritating to see crippled video every 5 minutes like this. Apple come on!">
&lt;/a>I was watching the WWDC2008 text feeds yesterday (like the one from &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/steve-jobs-keynote-live-from-wwdc-2008/">Engadget&lt;/a>), and today the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0806wdt546x/event/index.html">WWDC2008 video&lt;/a> is online. It's always better to watch this than to read an interpreted &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/theilife">twitter feed&lt;/a>. Today it was a bit of a challenge to view it because a lot of people are probably with me. I always set Quicktime to use the HTTP protocol over port 80, because that forces all the network packets to arrive in the correct order, and does not allow dropped packets.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![How to set Quicktime to use the HTTP protocol](afbeelding-1.png?w=128)
&lt;p>](afbeelding-1.png)On the left, you can see how I've configured to be able to see the keynote without too much problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the middle of all the nerdy &amp;quot;look we've ported a game&amp;quot; presentations, there was actually a very cool one. Mark Terry, a software developer for an English insurance company, has created an incredible piece of music software for the iPhone, called &lt;a href="http://moocowmusic.com/Band/">&amp;quot;MooCow Music Band&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. At about 40 minutes into the WWDC2008 Keynote video, you'll find his really nice demo, with cheers from the crowd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There's also a nice discussion on background processes and how they influence performance and battery life. It shows how, on a Samsung with Windows mobile, the user has to figure out which process to end. This then all leads to a discussion on the new Push Notification architecture in the iPhone 2.0 software which prevents software from having to poll servers. It also keeps your phonebill low, because there are no bits going back and forth to the phone every 10 seconds to see if the world has changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chinese character recognition was also a nice feature, it solves the problem with the Chinese language characters (of which there are a lot).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.me.com">&lt;img src="keynote_page_mobileme20080609.jpg" alt="Mobile Me logo">
&lt;/a>Finally, after a lot of complaints about .Mac not being up to par, Apple introduces &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">Mobile Me&lt;/a>, which replaces .Mac. Mobile Me finally looks like it expect to be looking for a proper Apple solution. It synchronizes with Apple and Windows platform, aswel as your iPod touch and iPhone. It has push notification, so that everything is synched immediately. The web interface is almost identical to Apple's Mail, contacts is looking like Address Book, etc. etc. Everything looks and feels like a desktop application. Lot's of AJAX-like functionality in there, which allows drag and drop, and on the fly contacts filtering, photo-skimming, image resizing and rotating...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What's also nice is the ability to take a picture with the iPhone (however bad the quality ;-) ) and immediately put it online in your really cool online Apple gallery. Really cool stuff and with the 20GB storage space finally worth considering the subscription. Let's hope they don't get into trouble with the other &lt;a href="http://www.mobileme.com.au/mobileme/index.wl">mobileme&lt;/a>'s &lt;a href="http://www.multiedit.com/mobileME.php">out&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2007/08/01/mobile">there&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the keynote, the new iPhone is introduced. 3G (UMTS) and built in GPS, better battery life, enterprise integration, and at a lower price. It's been on the news, and you probably have heard about the new iPhone already by now. Good news for me is that it's finally comming to the Netherlands. I only hope that I can buy it unlocked, because I'm not sure I want to switch to T-Mobile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-3.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.png?w=50" alt="The iPhone 3G, finally in White.">
&lt;/a>At 1 hour and 28 minutes into the keynote, there's a funny situation where Steve waits for a large website to load on the (old) EDGE iPhone. The 3G iPhone is about 2 to 3 times as fast as the EDGE phone, and approaches wifi speeds over 3g (UMTS) networks. Steve demonstrates the speed increase of the new iPhone, and the slow competition with the funny layouts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Features which seem to be little but are quite important to people: It has a flush headphone connector so you can use any headphone you'd like, and it's available in white (only if you buy the 16GB model for $299).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wonder when it will be available in Russia... :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clone Windows HD on Apple OSX machine</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/06/clone-windows-hd-on-apple-osx-machine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2008 21:07:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/06/clone-windows-hd-on-apple-osx-machine/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Last week, lightning struck at my parents apartment building (literaly). Other damages aside, my dad's PC also died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The guy at the PC repair shop warned my dad that &lt;em>&amp;quot;we may need to wipe the HD, do you have a backup&amp;quot;?&lt;/em> Ofcourse, all data was backed up daily and &amp;quot;off-site&amp;quot; at my house so all important data was safe. But just in case, we wanted to make an exact disk image of the drive, so that we could easily restore it when the PC returns from the store&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I wanted to have a future proof process, run on a Mac, something as follows:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Make an image file of the complete source harddisk including all partitions (in our case there were 3 NTFS partitions on the disk). The image file includes any boot records or loaders if they exist, and is an Apple DMG file so it can be mounted on OSX.
2. Store the image file on a server disk (so it in turn gets backed up)
3. When there's trouble, we now have 2 options, which are
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>a) mount the image and restore 1 or 2 important files
b) write/restore the image to a new disk&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we bought a second 500GB drive to play around with, and try the restores on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Mac Disk Utility, I made an &amp;quot;MBR&amp;quot; disk image of a drive. Mounting this image gave me the access to all 3 NTFS partitions and data on them. However, for some strange reason, Disk Utility could not restore it's own disk image to the drive,Â  because it does not allow me to drag the target disk into the target disk field (use google to find more people having this problem). Mucking around with the command line tool &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)">&amp;quot;dd&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, I actually managed to restore the DMG back onto a physical drive, but for some reason, the primary partition was damaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digging around on the internet, I found that the following method may be the only reliable way to do this and meet all my requirements. It's relatively simple, although it does take a trip to the command line (which is really not very Apple like).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Backup the DRIVE, not a PARTITION&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What Apple calls a &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disk&amp;quot; is actually often just a partition on a physical disk. A physical disk can have multiple partitions, which appear as multiple &amp;quot;disks&amp;quot; in the Finder or Disk Utility. Because we want to make an image of the physical disk, we need to find out where that disk is. In the Terminal, use to following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>diskutil list
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You'll get a list of all the physical drives, and the partitions which are on there. For example, our testdisk shows up as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>/dev/disk3
Â Â  #:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  TYPE NAMEÂ Â Â Â Â  SIZEÂ Â Â Â  IDENTIFIER
Â Â  0: FDisk_partition_schemeÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  *465.8 Gi disk3
Â Â  1:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  DOS_FAT_32 TESTDISK 465.8 Gi disk3s1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The physical disk is known to the system as /dev/disk3, and the first (and only) pastition on there is a FAT32 partition, and the name of the partition is TESTDISK. To make a DMG of the complete disk with all it's partitions, the following command is enough:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>dd if=/dev/disk3 of=/Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The command will take a (long, long) while to complete. I've read some posts where people were waiting for days for dd to complete their image. There's also no progress bar. Terrible, but for now I can't help you with this without getting into rediculous trickery as found on some &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b1cyNigny8">l33tsp34k&lt;/a> hippie h4xor blogs out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fun thing about this trick is, that OSX is able to mount that DMG file. You just double-click it, and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.boomcounter.org/">boom&lt;/a>&amp;quot;. There are your partitions. A big problem is that these images are uncompressed. So you'll need 500GB free space to backup a 500GB drive. That's not funny. You can circumvent that by having the data zipped before writing it to disk but that means you'll not be able to mount it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing it in compressed form (which is even slower) can be done like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>dd if=/dev/disk3 | gzip -9 &amp;gt; /Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg.gz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Restore the DRIVE (not the partition)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To restore a dmg onto a physical disk, get a disk which is at least the size as the original disk. Having the original disk's size in the filename like in the example above helps you to remember that in a few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After checking which disk you need to write to with the diskutil (as shown abve), restoring an uncompressed disk image merely requires you to swap input and output parameters, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>dd if=/Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg of=/dev/disk3
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that this works because in my case I haven't rebooted or reconnected drives, so the drive I need to write to is still /dev/disk3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you did the gzip compression trick mentioned above, you need to get a bit more fancy:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat /Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg.gz | gzip -d | dd of=/dev/disk3
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Although all of this works, I hope that somebody, somewhere can show me a simple, clean, OSX native, GIU based solution to this, meeting the 3 requirements in this article.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New York online...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/04/new-york-online/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2008 17:37:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/06/04/new-york-online/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Another great example showing the differences between OSX and Windows. Bot applications synchronize your phone over bluetooth. Both applications are simple to use, but one is simpler. And contrary to expectations, this time the Windows version (left) will cost you money, and the OSX version (right) is free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="sync.gif">&lt;img src="sync.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a> &lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.png?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although you'd expect the Windows version to do more with all these bells and wistles on the screen, but it's actually &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISync">iSync&lt;/a> that also synchronizes the calendar to my phone, and back. Automatically. No configuration needed, it does what is considered logical to the sensible mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple and OSX are just like a &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Volkswagen_New_Beetle_Germany.jpg">Volkswagen New Beetle&lt;/a>. Either you like it, or you don't. But either way, it's good that it's here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For the record: I don't like the Volkswagen New Beetle, and I do like OSX. My Mac Mini is absolutely by far the best computer I have bought in the past 5 years, maybe even the best computer I've bought ever. No kidding.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't buy: Belkin TuneCast II</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/05/23/dont-buy-belkin-tunecast-ii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2008 18:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/05/23/dont-buy-belkin-tunecast-ii/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="341843_rb_00_fbeps.jpg">&lt;img src="341843_rb_00_fbeps.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>I am in the market for a new car. That means I'm in the market for a new car stereo. I decided that the iPod is a far better way to listen to my music in stead of keeping CD's in the car or listening to the 10.000 crappy FM stations in the Netherlands. Since &lt;a href="http://www.dension.com/icelinkgateway500.php">Dension&lt;/a> does not make a cable for my new car, I decided to go for an FM transmitter. Buying the cheap Belkin TuneCast II FM transmitter, I got even less then what I payed for.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->It looks promising from the package, but it was really a big waste of money. When operated using the included AAA batteries, I get no reception at all. Only when using the 12V car adapter the power output slightly increased and I was able to get the car radio to pick up the TuneCast signal, but only with very much static noise.
&lt;p>I took it out of the car to make sure the problem was not my car radio. At home, I put the TuneCast on top of the home stereo (only 4 cm away from the antenna). It was still very hard to get a signal at all, and I have never got it working without any static noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the manual, the iPod should be set to a moderate volume, and once connected the TuneCast will automatically switch on. In my case, I had to turn the volume of the iPod all the way to 100% before the TuneCast switched on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I spent 20 minutes of fiddling and finding a free frequency (the Netherlands is crowded with radio signals), I noticed that the output volume of the TuneCast is also very low. In the car, I need to crank up the volume to 100% on my car radio to get a normal listening level. This means that if I switch stations by accident, I can possibly blow up my speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My conclusion is: the TuneCast II does not do what it promises. It's output power is way too low, even on 12V car power, it needs high volume input and produces low volume output with a lot of static noise, even when being VERY close to the reciever antenna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DO NOT BUY THE BELKIN TUNECAST II&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Edit:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9511.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9511.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>After typing this post I decided to try to get more signal out of the Tunecast. It did not work, but I did find out which terminals to use when trying to get signal from the tunecast. Maybe you can wire it straight into your radio or something. I'm not planning on doing that, but here are some pictures of the mods I tried to do. It might get you started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Opening the TuneCast II is really simple, there is 1 screw underneath the &amp;quot;QC&amp;quot; sticker in the battery compartment. Take it out. Pry the two halves of the tunecast loose they are interlocked with small plastic pins, nothing you can break easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9512.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9512.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Once opened, you can remove another screw to take out the printed circuit board. On the front side of the circuit boart you'll notice the wires going to the earphone plug. The antenna of the Tunecast is incorprated in the (rather short) earphone cable. In my case this was the blue wire (also marked with &amp;quot;ANT&amp;quot;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9513.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9513.jpg?w=114" alt="">
&lt;/a>If you flip over the PCB, you can see a few testing points. Two of these can be used to attach a small dipole antenna. TP9 is ground, and TP8 is the antenna output. I tried making a &lt;a href="http://www.electronics-radio.com/articles/radio/antennas/dipole/fm-dipole-antenna.php">small dipole&lt;/a>, but transmision power was not increased enough to get a clear signal to my radio (still 4cm away from the radio). I think the output power can be routed into an FM amplifier so the whole neighbourhood can listen to your station, but for me that's not an option since I was looking for a simple and small device to listen to my iPod in the car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9518.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9518.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Another interesting tip: I noticed that the &amp;quot;backlight&amp;quot; is really not a backlight, but 2 green leds mounted somewhere near the LCD. If you'd like to get slightly more light onto the LCD, you can try to paint the inside of the casing using white matt paint (like shown).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok that's it, I'm throwing mine in the garbage can and will start looking for something else. I hope you enjoyed this â¬25,- blog post.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A while ago there was a bit of a hype on the net around the song &lt;a href="http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=cOEKASLb4lM">&amp;quot;Again and Again&amp;quot;&lt;/a> by &amp;quot;the Bird and the Bee&amp;quot;. It's a great song, and the video is pretty okay. For &lt;a href="http://twit.tv/mbw">MacBreak Weekly&lt;/a> listeners this is old news, but actually there is a much better version of the video clip.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->This version is done on a Mac, with a Mac, and it makes the song a lot more interesting. See if you can recognize all the programs used in this video (it's fast!):

&lt;p>I really like my racing car, but it takes up so much time to get everything right and be competative, that I've decided to sell it. The plan is to use the money to buy a Helicopter. Yes that's right. An airborne lownmawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->In the past, I have had much fun getting the [HPI Proceed](http://www.hpiracing.com/kits/proceed/proc-m.htm) 1:8 scale IC car to Europe, [driving](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/reports/20020808/index.html) it, [promoting](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/) it, and [talking about it](http://www.rc-racing.com/cgi-bin/backtalk/pistachio/confhome?conf=hpi) online. A few years ago I had to stop my hobby because it took too much time, and I didn't want to half-ass it. Because I had so much fun with it, and spent so much time with it, I couldn't really get myself into selling it. But now, I'm ready. [I'm selling the car.](http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/3102253)
&lt;p>I think it's a nice time to switch hobbies, and go airborne. I have had lots of fun with my amazing Silverlit helicopter, and about a week ago one of my friends bought a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYELAHulc8">Walkera 60B Electric helicopter&lt;/a>. It look's like fun, so I'm getting one as soon as I've raised enough funds. Selling the car will definetely help :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good teaser huh, you didn't think I had a full-scale racing car and was getting a full-scale helicopter, now did you? :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No more www.localhost.com</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/05/06/no-more-wwwlocalhostcom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2008 11:15:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/05/06/no-more-wwwlocalhostcom/</guid><description>

When I screw up my configuration or forget to start myEntunnel, Firefox is &amp;quot;smart enough&amp;quot; to change &amp;quot;localhost:9090&amp;quot; into &amp;quot;http://www.localhost.com:9090&amp;quot; when it can't reach the local port.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More people are having this problem, and apparently there is a configuration trick to stop Firefox from adding &amp;quot;www&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;com&amp;quot; to the URL when it can't reach the site.

&lt;p>As you may know, Norton and Symantec were originally rivals in the anti-virus software market. Then, Norton bought Symantec and the two anti-virus products merged into &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_AntiVirus">Norton Anti Virus&lt;/a>. Yes, I know, I'm talking PC here. Bare with me on this one.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->If you are the "you do something with computers, don't you?" free computer repair guy to a lot of people around you, you have probably uninstalled Norton Anti Virus Trial Edition from more than a few newly bought PC's. And it was painful. Admit it. I know. I've been there. Several times.
&lt;p>A few months ago I discovered that maybe Norton is fixing this. But strangely enough, not in their software. They're using the community to solve it. And no, it's not by open-sourcing it either. It's by buying user opinions. Yes, you've read that right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-1.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-1.png" alt="effectiveness of Norton Propaganda">
&lt;/a>Check out the screenshot. It's an &lt;a href="http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon's Mechanical Turk&lt;/a> &amp;quot;HIT&amp;quot; (Human Intelligence Task). Here, the requester asks people to post positive reviews of the Norton Anti Virus products as part of a French scientific research project. (no, it's not photoshopped)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Norton is not really the requester, and I am probably blowing this out of proportion. But next time you're on a forum, and people start telling you how wonderful Norton Antivirus is, stop and think for a minute. They might be getting payed to tell you this. Doesn't that feel awfully close to a mini-&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda">propaganda&lt;/a>? Yes, I know, this is not news. But this screenshot reminded me of how easily some people trust information on the internet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Online forums are great for sharing information. I really like the internet, and hey, I wouldn't be blogging if I didn't, now would I? But for all you know, I could be an Apple execitive trying to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/02/hidden-get-a-mac-ads/">get people to &lt;/a>buy an Apple computer. Or a Seagate employee trying to sell you a drive instead of &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/10/24/no-such-thing-harddisk-warranty/">repairing your old one&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>Google calendar is the new &amp;quot;Cool&amp;quot; in the calendar world. Or at least, the guys at work seem to think so. For me, a 100% online calendar is not always a good solution, because I can't take it with me. Getting Google calendar to sync with iCal would help, because that syncs to my phone and iPod. I tried BusySync and Spanning Sync to do this. One of them succeeded.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I've always been a FiloFax guy. My organizer is a typical one, it's rather big, and contains all business cards, papers, copies and notes I think are important enough to carry around. Every now and then (about every 2 years when I think about it) I try to migrate to a digital version. I've had a [Psion 3c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_3), an [HP iPaq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipaq), I tried to do the "[Print](http://www.43folders.com/forum/2007/10/10/google-calendar-index-card)-a-[Google](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=41067)-[Calendar](http://lifehacker.com/358308/convert-your-google-calendar-to-pdf)" trick, and even briefly used my [Sony Ericsson T610](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_T610) as my calendar.
&lt;p>Every time, after a while, I find myself switching back to my trusty FiloFax. Usually because something happens to my calendar, or me not being able to access it. Failing backups, failing batteries, unreadable screens, awkward interfaces, and inability to scribble a simple drawing in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last weekend I entered a new cycle of getting it all digital again. I've been digital for a complete week now, and it doesn't feel too awkward. Maybe this time it will work...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Backing up&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before trying anything, I backed up my Google Calendars and iCal calendars. There wasn't much in them, but it's nice to be able to return to a known state. Yes, I have Time Machine but the trick of a backup system is not having to rely on it in your daily work. So here are 2 important links:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=37111">Backing up your Google Calendar&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://leopardtips.blogspot.com/2007/11/back-up-ical-and-address-book.html">Backing up your iCal Calendar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Problem&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get a usable solution to view and update my calendar online aswell as on the road, without manual actions to get everything synchronized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Solution&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use Google Calendar for online editting, use iCal as central hub for synchronizing to all my devices, use my Nokia 6300 for viewing and editting on the road. My iPod nano is a nice extra for viewing my calendar when my phone dies on the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple has done a great job of synchronizing iCal to all my devices, so that's a no-brainer. iTunes and iSync take care of that flawlessly, even without me asking, for a couple of months already. It's just that I wasn't really using iCal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The challenge is in getting Google Calendar to sync with iCal. There are a &lt;a href="http://www.twistermc.com/blog/2007/06/28/sync-ical-google">couple of solutions&lt;/a> to do this, and I choose to give BusySync and Spanning Sync a try, because these feel most suited to my wishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BusySync&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first program I tried was &lt;a href="http://www.busymac.com/">BusySync&lt;/a>. It's a bit bloated for what I wanted to do with it, but it's pricing model is nice, $25 for a license. I downloaded the trail and without reading the manual (because I think good software does not really need one) I tried to sync 2 existing calendars, one in iCal and one in Google Calendar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I immediately screwed up all my calendars, 3 times in a row. This did not feel good. BusySync has a way too complex user interface, too many features, and has one very big flaw: It can not sync an existing Google Calendar into an existing iCal calendar (at least, I didn't get how to do that). It is not clear about what it's doing and the whole &amp;quot;publish/subscribe&amp;quot; thing confuses me because I don't want to do either. I want to &lt;em>Synchronize both ways&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BusySync is trying to be the all-in-one solution for sharing calendars with Google, your friends, the neighbours dog, and back. It's more like a &amp;quot;Calendar Server&amp;quot; kind of application which feels like it has to be online, all the time. This may be fun for the tweak-freaks out there, but it sure was not solving my problem in an easy and elegant way. So, BusySync was quickly uninstalled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SpanningSync&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much less bloated, &lt;a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync&lt;/a> is a piece of software that only tries to solve 1 problem, and tries to solve it good. Spannig Sync can only do one thing, and that is synchronize Google Calendars with iCal calendars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Immediately after installing, I entered my Google acount data, and Spanning Sync fetches the Calendar list from Google. It then asks which iCal calendar I want to sync with which Google Calendar. Nice. Within 3 minutes, I had all (existing) Google Calendars synced with my (existing) iCal calendars. Flawlessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I tried turning on the &lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tip/2007/01/29.1.shtml">birthday feature of iCal&lt;/a>, and sync that to a new Google calendar. Spanning Sync politely warns me that this Calendar is not editable, and changes in it's Google counter part will not result in changes in iCal. Great, that's the kind of warnings I can live with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After synchronizing, I renamed my Google Birthday calendar to add the words &amp;quot;Read Only&amp;quot;, so I would not make the mistake of adding appointments there. Spanning Sync has no trouble with renamed Google Calendars. It recognizes them by a hidden unique identifier. Rename as you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see who has won the competition for me, hands down. Spanning Sync does a really nice job in synchronizing my calendars. The only downside is it's strange pricing strategy. You can use Spanning Sync for a year for $25. Or, you can buy an unlimited license, which will set you back $65.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I returned to my FiloFax nearly every time I tried to &amp;quot;go digital&amp;quot;, I think I'll pay for a yearly license en see where it all ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The showdown&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case Spanning Sync &amp;quot;just works&amp;quot; and in the end, that's what counts. I haven't touched the Spanning Sync preference pane for a few days, and it is still synchronizing nicely. My phone is also &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/homezone-more-seemless-sync/">synchronizing nicely&lt;/a>, so I really feel that the calendar is there for me, in stead of the &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/remember-the-milk-review/#more-263">other way around&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the top of my head, here are a few thoughts when comparing BusySync and Spanning Sync next to eachother:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >BusySyncSpanning Sync&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Multi-purpose, all-in-one, lots of bells and whistles
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Single purpose, simple user interface
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Publish/Subscribe model
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Two-way synchronization
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Can not sync existing Calendars
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Can sync existing Calendars
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Cheap, simple license
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Strange yearly license
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >$25
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >$25 a year, or $65 for an unlimited license
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>For now, it's my Nokia 6300, iCal, Google Calendar and Spanning sync for me. But maybe, in a few weeks, you'll read hwo lovely my FiloFax really is. It doesn't need batteries, is crash-proof and allways-on. :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sell a Name or an Image?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/30/sell-a-name-or-an-image/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Apr 2008 08:45:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/30/sell-a-name-or-an-image/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The new marketing &amp;quot;trick&amp;quot; seems to be to give a product a nice name, which sounds &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;design&amp;quot; like. So the marketing boys come up with a nice name. Compaq for instance has been using &amp;quot;pressario&amp;quot; for a while now. But when I say that I have a &amp;quot;pressario&amp;quot;, do you really know what kind of computer I have? Do you know which computer to buy when you hear my praise on my great new computer?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Probably not. And that's what amazes me at the current marketing tactics. Let me give you a couple of examples. If I say I have a pressario, I could have any of these computers (and this is ony a small selection of the ones I found):
&lt;p>&lt;a href="images.jpg">&lt;img src="images.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;a href="images-1.jpg">&lt;img src="images-1.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a> &lt;a href="images-2.jpg">&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="images-2.jpg">&lt;img src="images-2.jpg?w=135" alt="">
&lt;/a> &lt;a href="images-3.jpg">&lt;img src="images-3.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So there's a problem for Compaq, which they have created themselves. &amp;quot;Pressario&amp;quot; does not identify anything. It can be a laptop, a desktop, and AMD processor, an Intel processor, with or without DVD player, small or large amounts of memory, and with or without monitor or keyboard. So what does &amp;quot;Pressario&amp;quot; mean?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem seels to be common for modern marketing. Look at the Renault MÃ©gane for example. When Renault just started with the MÃ©gane series, it was really clear what kind of car you were buying. But now, there are many MÃ©ganes on the market. Here's a small selection of MÃ©gane models I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="images-4.jpg">&lt;img src="images-4.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a> &lt;a href="images-5.jpg">&lt;img src="images-5.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="images-6.jpg">&lt;img src="images-6.jpg?w=150" alt="">
&lt;/a> &lt;a href="images-8.jpg">&lt;img src="images-8.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what kind of car you drive? In the old days, when you had a &amp;quot;Mustang&amp;quot;, people knew what car you had. The name was synonym to an image, and people knew what car to ask for if they wanted to have it. And the sales people knew what car to order for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No matter how hard you try to give a product a name, if you use that same name for a different product, people get confused, and you will never be able to build an image.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get an Onscreen Keyboard in OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/29/get-an-onscreen-keyboard-in-osx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2008 20:38:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/29/get-an-onscreen-keyboard-in-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Always forgetting how to do accents on characters, or where the euro sign (â¬) is? Use the on-screen keyboard and see where the special characters are while holdin down the option key, or the shift-option combination.

&lt;p>In my last post, I wrote about how I got &lt;a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">HomeZone&lt;/a> to detect my bluetooth phone, and automatically start iSync. While I was playing with it, I noticed how HomeZone opens the Address book application and iSync, and doesn't close them. To make it more seemless, I used a script I found at &lt;a href="http://www.technocrat.ca/?p=44">The Technocrat&lt;/a> to start and stop iSync without interfering with your work. Here's how I did that.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First, I opened the script editor and typed the following script into it (slightly modified from the one at Technocrat):
&lt;pre>&lt;code>tell application &amp;quot;Finder&amp;quot;
set iSyncRunning to (number of items in
(processes whose name is &amp;quot;iSync&amp;quot;) is greater than 0)
tell application &amp;quot;iSync&amp;quot;
if last sync is less than ((current date) - 120) then
synchronize
end if
end tell
tell application &amp;quot;iSync&amp;quot;
repeat while (syncing is true)
delay 1
end repeat
if iSyncRunning is not true then
quit
end if
end tell
end tell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then, I saved this script as an application called &amp;quot;iSyncNow.app&amp;quot; . On the save dialog, make sure that &amp;quot;keep running&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;show on screen&amp;quot; are NOT thicked, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-9.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-9.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, open the HomeZone preferences and configure HomeZone to run this application when your phone is in range. My configuration looks as follows:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>With this simple little trick, my Mac Mini has become a lot cooler. When I approach the computer, I see the iSync logo appear in the dock, it bounces a few times, and then it dissapears. My phone is now always synchronized with my iCal, without popups or manual actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that the script prevents iSync to synchronize if the last synchronization was less than 2 minutes (120 seconds) ago. You can adjust this by editting the &amp;quot;120&amp;quot; in the applescript to any number of seconds you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!

&lt;p>Recently, I installed &lt;a href="http://www.azarhi.com/Projects/DSW/index.php">&amp;quot;Do Something When&amp;quot;&lt;/a> and use it to start rsync scripts when I plug in certain USB devices. By doing this, every time I plug in my USB memory stick containing my &lt;a href="http://fpx.de/fp/Software/Gorilla/">Password Gorilla&lt;/a> password databases, it gets backed up (Apple style, with timestamps). Needless to say, it then gets backed up by TimeMachine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-8.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-8.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>I also needed this hands-off approach for synchronizing my iCal calendar with my new Nokia 6300 phone. Enter &lt;a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">Homezone&lt;/a>, a very cool app that can detect if a certain Bluetooth device is in range, and start iSync. It can also lock and unlock your screen when your phone is in or out of range, respectively. I did find some buttons looking funny when running it in Leopard, but it does work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up: a review between Busy Sync and Spanning Sync for synchronizing iCal with Google Calendar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stretch pants...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/26/stretch-pants/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2008 14:13:04 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/26/stretch-pants/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Like buildings, software usually a deviation of a standard structure. The architect chooses the structure his design will be based upon. After making design adjustments to the structure to cater the requirements, the architect supervises the builders. Like a building architect, the software architect supervises while walking around in the structure during the build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software projects can get so large and complex that the architect can not posibly monitor all the code all the time. This is where te tooling comes in. In this post, I will explain how to use &lt;a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">Checkstyle&lt;/a> to automatically monitor the basic architectural integrety of the software.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->When designing software, we usually start of with drawing high level building blocks on a piece of paper. In most of my sketches, these building blocks map to Java packages in the code, and the arrows between the blocks represent communication paths or method calls between the packages.
&lt;p>Interfaces and calls between packages are an important part of the architecture or design. One of the ways to monitor design integrity is to monitor which packages are using other packages, and the way packages interact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Packages are almost a Java-specific term for what other languages call âmodulesâ, or âlibrariesâ. The way these packages are grouped in graphical representations of the design is very often layer-like. For more information on layers, maybe you should read about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_tier">3-tier architecture&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The word &lt;a href="http://www.google.nl/search?q=define%3Atier">âTierâ&lt;/a> is a more exact term than layer, but to keep things less confusing by introducing another term, Iâll stick with the word âlayerâ.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with any design, it is important to stick to the plan. Software developers have no physical boundaries to access the different layers of the software. This means that during development, layers can be interconnected in a way that was not intended by the architect. These connections are called âLayer violationsâ. One of the important tasks for the architect is to prevent these violations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To prevent developers making layer violations, the design should be simple and clear to the developers. In essence, developers should not see the need to violate the layer access rules. Make the right thing to do, the easy thing to do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If layer violations are a common practice in a project, the architect needs to investigate the reasons for these violations, and may need to reconsider the design or the layer access rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eliminating layer violations will:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Reduce complexity of the software
* Prevent circular dependencies
* Reduce vulnerability to exploits
* Improve code reusability
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When software projects become too large to monitor each line of sourcecode by hand, tooling is needed to monitor these Layer Violations. One of the tools which is able to do this for Java code is &lt;a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/">CheckStyle&lt;/a>. The Checkstyle module we use to monitor layer violations is called &lt;a href="http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/config_imports.html#ImportControl">&amp;quot;Import Control&amp;quot;&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Example:&lt;/strong>
Suppose we want to create a simple (java web) application. This application consists of some screens for users to enter data, a bunch of business rules for processing this data, and data storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The generic way to solve this problem is to logically group the functionality into packages. The following packages will be used in our example application:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * **Frontend** - Contains the screens (this can contain Wicket, Tapestry or JSP techoligy for instance
* **Service** - Contains the business logic for processing the data. The servicelayer usually contains the highest level of abstraction, because it uses the core and data access layers to get things done.
* **Core** - Data object which represent entities in the system. These are usually beans or POJO's, and represent real-world things like &amp;quot;User&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Order&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Invoice&amp;quot;.
* **Data Access** - This layer has the responsibility of storing Core objects into the database, and retrieving them.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="layers.png">&lt;img src="layers.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>In the image on the right, you can see the different packages, and the way they are organized. These type of images are the reason for calling the different packages &amp;quot;layers&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The green arrows between the layers represent normal relationships, or method calls, if you like. The Frontend layer uses the service layer. The Service layer uses the Data Access layer. All layers need to pass Core objects to eachother, so they all have to be able to use the Core layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the right side we see a red arrow from the Data Access layer to the Frontend layer. This arrow is an example of a so called &amp;quot;layer violation&amp;quot;. Having a relation to the Frontend layer makes the Data Access layer dependant on the Frontend, and could also lead to circular references.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Checkstyle&lt;/strong>
Checkstyle is a program which can parse Java source code, and create a list of coding style violations and architectural errors. It also has a maven plugin, which we are going to use in our example project to get a report on layer violations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we need to add Checkstyle to the project. Layer violation monitoring was added to Checkstyle in one of the later releases. To make sure that we have the correct version of Checkstyle, add the folowing dependency to your Maven (1.0) project.xml:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;checkstyle&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;3.0.1&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;plugin&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Should you want the Checkstyle report to be automatically included in the generated Maven site, you can optionally add&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;report&amp;gt;maven-checkstyle-plugin&amp;lt;/report&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To the &lt;reports> section of the project.xml file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we have added Checkstyle to our Maven configuration, we need to configure Checkstyle to check our layer violations. Checkstyle can check a lot more, but we're only using it to check Layer Violations for the sake of this article.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to tell the Maven Checkstyle plugin where it can find itâs configuration file. Add the following line to the project.properties in the root of your maven project:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>#Checkstyle
maven.checkstyle.check.tests=false
maven.checkstyle.fail.on.violation=false
maven.checkstyle.properties=checkstyle-config.xml
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, create a checkstyle-config.xml in the root of your project which looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE module PUBLIC &amp;quot;-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Check Configuration 1.2//EN&amp;quot; &amp;quot;http://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/configuration_1_2.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;module name=&amp;quot;Checker&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;severity&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;warning&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;module name=&amp;quot;TreeWalker&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;module name=&amp;quot;ImportControl&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;severity&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;error&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&amp;quot;file&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;checkstyle-import-control.xml&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/module&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/module&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/module&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>As you can see in this configuration file, checkstyle will look for a checkstyle-import-control.xml file containing the Layer access rules.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An example of this file which would match our example would look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE import-control PUBLIC
&amp;quot;-//Puppy Crawl//DTD Import Control 1.0//EN&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;http://www.puppycrawl.com/dtds/import_control_1_0.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;import-control pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;!âallow access to utility libraries --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;java&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;org&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;sun&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;subpackage name=&amp;quot;frontend&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.frontend&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.service&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.core&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;javax.servlet&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/subpackage&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;subpackage name=&amp;quot;service&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.service&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.dataaccess&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.core&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/subpackage&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;subpackage name=&amp;quot;dataaccess&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.dataaccess&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.core&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/subpackage&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;subpackage name=&amp;quot;core&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;allow pkg=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.example.core&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/subpackage&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/import-control&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>There are a few things to note in this configuration file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * It is allowed to use java.*, org.*, and sun.* packages abywhere in the code. This is to allow normal usage of java.util.List for instance.
* The frontend is a web frontend in this example, and accesses javax.servlet. Note that the service, backend and core layers are not allowed to use servlet classes.
* Packages are allowed to access themselves. This is done so that sub-packages made by developers are not immediately detected and seen as a layer violation.
* There are no nested subpackages in this example. You can nest subpackage elements if you need to.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Having configured everything, you can now run âmaven checstyle:reportâ to see how your code is matching your design. If you run a âmaven siteâ, then the Layer Violations will be visible as a report in the left menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You may also want to checkout the Checkstyle eclipse plugin, which will visually mark the violations in you sourcefiles and add them to the âProblemsâ view. It will help you to find and fix the violations much quicker.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The vi religion</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/05/the-vi-religion/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2008 22:22:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/04/05/the-vi-religion/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Every age has it's tools. Many, many years ago, in 1976 to be exact, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy">squinty-eyed nerds&lt;/a> with a social deficiency ruled the computer world. They talked to eachother in a secret code, wore geeky clothes and made sure that everybody thought that computers were magic. To make sure that nobody could ever use a computer to edit a file, they all swore to never ever use another editor than... &lt;scary music> &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi&lt;/a> &amp;lt;/scary music&amp;gt;.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->To make sure nobody understood how to work with vi, they had the editor behave like 4 different programs. To switch between the modes, you had to ritually punch the right combination of keys while singing the imaginary theme song of [NetHack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethack). Backwards. To make it all look as a good thing, they even came up with a techy sounding term for all this: "modal editor"
&lt;p>For good measure, the SONAU (Secret Organization of Nerds Against Usability) even came up with a devious name for the editor. With a reference to the world &amp;quot;visual&amp;quot;, nobody was going to believe you were using an editor even if they were looking at your screen full of green text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vi even has a&amp;quot;camouflage&amp;quot; mode where it starts up showing a column of &amp;quot;~&amp;quot; characters. Ha! Now the mortal user will be really lost! Nobody will be able to edit a file, ever again! &lt;em>MUHAHAHAHAAAAAA&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ok sorry. lost myself a bit there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While the SONAU people were in charge,they made sure that every computer shipped with vi. No other editors were allowed. A few brave people at the University of Washington secretly wrote a nice editor called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico_%28text_editor%29">pico&lt;/a>. They had to come up with a way to get this editor onto many systems without the SONAU people noticing. So they wrapped pico into what probably is the first Trojan Horse on a computer: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_%28e-mail_client%29">pine&lt;/a>. Cleverly disquised as a hard to use email client, pine was approved by the SONAU High Concil and before anybody realized, pico was on many computers around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With pico, some people where actually able to edit documents and even programs, and the SONAU lost quite a bit of it's powers. Now, after 30+ years, computers are actually usable, and editors are actually &amp;quot;visual&amp;quot;. Because SONAU still has an active underground organization, the term &amp;quot;visual&amp;quot; is still being avoided, and the strange term &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG&lt;/a>&amp;quot; is used. Actually, the term WYSIWYG also applies to vi in combination with a 9-needle &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix_printer">dot matrix printer&lt;/a>, but nobody dares to say that out loud. You also didn't read this on this blog, capiche?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many SONAU members became infurtile by the green screen radiation. An even bigger group thought that women were creatures whose only purpose in life is yell (g)EEEK, turn around and run away. Still, some SONAU members managed to avoid getting a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwin_award">Darwin Award&lt;/a> and had children. These children were subtelly brainwashed, and are now scattered over the internet, posting messages about how good their life is with vi.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Painfully desoriented and unable to see the big picture, these children would rather count the atoms in the plastic molecules of their red bike helmet than see the big truck that's comming their way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had a collegue like this once. At first, he thought I had supernatural powers for being able to refactor multiple files with code within 5 seconds. In weeks of therapeutic talks, healing and training sessions, I finally got him to see that it was &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse&lt;/a>, not me, who was doing the refactoring he could not get done in vi. Shortly after he realized I was a mere mortal, and not even exceptionally bright, it dawned: All the work he'd done in the past 10 years could have been done in 2 weeks with a better suited tool. He left the company, and nobody saw him since...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blog.eleutian.com/2008/01/18/VimScreencast1.aspx">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.png" alt="Example of a bad editor">
&lt;/a>Today I found another poor soul. Even while doing a screencast, typing in vi and telling about what he is doing, he can't see that using the letters &amp;quot;h&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;j&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;k&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;l&amp;quot; for navigation is very strange while your keyboard has had arrow keys for the past 20 years, and a mouse for the past 15 years or so. The flashing text in the film like &amp;quot;Esc is bad, Ctrl-[ is good&amp;quot; shows how big the psychiatric problems of vi users is. No sane persion today will press a cryptic 2-key combination while being able to use the much more intuitive &amp;quot;Esc&amp;quot; key to escape from a certain mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="http://blog.eleutian.com/2008/01/18/VimScreencast1.aspx">the screencast&lt;/a> and by your reaction, I will tell if you are a SONAU member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For people without patience, here are a few absolutely hilarious texts in the screencast which will make you wonder why people are still using vi:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Insert mode: don't use the arrow keys
* Block cursor is &amp;quot;normal mode&amp;quot;, thin cursor is &amp;quot;insert mode&amp;quot;
* Esc (bad) ^[ (good)
* Visual mode is like holding &amp;quot;Shift&amp;quot; to select stuff
* Arrow keys bad!
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>vi is the editor which in &amp;quot;normal mode&amp;quot; can not edit text, and uses a seperate &amp;quot;append&amp;quot; mode to add text to the &lt;em>end&lt;/em> of a line, while using &amp;quot;insert&amp;quot; mode to insert text &lt;em>inside&lt;/em> a line. It's users are misguided members of their own &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sect">sect&lt;/a>, firmly helping eachother to keep up vi's name, while ignoring reality and other people's belief or needs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It's not about tools; it's about people</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/30/its-not-about-tools-its-about-people/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2008 16:22:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/30/its-not-about-tools-its-about-people/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Last week a collegue of mine did an introductory talk about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">RUP&lt;/a> (Rational Unified Process). It was an interesting talk about how RUP can be applied in projects, what the philosophy is behind RUP, and lessons learned during her first RUP workshop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the talk, we discussed how RUP looked a lot like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSDM">DSDM&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_Programming">XP&lt;/a>. In all these methods, developers are arrogant enough to &amp;quot;demand&amp;quot; customers to conform to their process. Sure there is a lot to be said for consulting the customer often, and having lots of pre-releases, but the customer is still the customer, not your in-house &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance">QA department&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Another funny thing is that all these methods are trying to solve "problems" which were carefully described by [Frederick Brooks in 1975](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythical_man-month).
&lt;p>The past 33 years, a lot has changed in the computer industry. Computers have become much faster, programming languages much more powerful, offices have airconditioning and good coffee, and you no longer need to have a soldering iron to be a good programmer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, in the past 33 years, people have not changed. Programmers tend to fiddle too long with a cool, simple, fast but wrong solution to a non-existing customer problem. Managers tend to report &amp;quot;on schedule&amp;quot; while actually they are behind schedule. Customers think that the testing phase is there to be removed in case of a time/budget problem. And still, the majority of people think that simply hiring more people will get the job done faster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The real problem in a project is not hardware. It's not software. It's not planning. It's not RUP, DSDM, Agile or XP. The real problems in a project are people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckaly, we're not all lost. Some projects actually do get finished on time, on budget, and with all features included. These successes are often attributed to the methodologies used, the brilliant programming language, or the good weather. Do you know what I think? These succeses are nothing more than the result of a good team of people, who actually care for the project to become a success. A team which has enough common sense to know what to do, and when to do it. A team which gets a kick out of having a happy customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing computer programs is a bit like solving a lot of puzzles in a day. It's a creative process, and although you can make rough estimates, you'll never know how much puzzles you are going to solve today. Writing programs in a team is a bit more complicated. You need to know what your team members are up to, and what their strong and weak points are. Deviding the puzzles between the team members needs to be done with great care.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having a process like RUP or any other (maybe self-made) process will be fine, but will only work if everybody in the team knows why this process was introduced,what it solves and what their role is in that process. If the goal is clear, and the team is a true team, the members will have no problem correcting eachother, and accepting corrections from eachother. It will become a sport.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the real solutions in a project are people. More precisely: people who take their profession seriously, 24x7.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DOCTYPE is a myth...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/25/doctype-is-a-myth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Mar 2008 22:33:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/25/doctype-is-a-myth/</guid><description>
&lt;p>... and other wisdom from Joel. Finally, after weeks of slightly boring posts about travel, speeches and FogBugz, Joel has an article on his blog he was so famous for: &lt;a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/03/17.html">Martian Headsets&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The article discusses the problems with the HTML spec, and numerous other problems developers are facing these days. That, and the Martians' strange fascination for all kinds and shades of red.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At times, the article remembered me of some thoughts I have during my dayjob:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Minimize. (also known as the [KISS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principle)
* Have a contract early in the process. Make it testable. Find a way to handle problems in the contract.
* Be strict and transparent. Fail early and explain.
* Using a standard and conforming to it are two different things.
* Communicate.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.thumbnail.png" alt="Nokia 6300 andÂ iSync">
&lt;/a>Last week, my trusty &lt;a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_T610">Sony Ericsson T610 &lt;/a>became a bit awkward to use. The &amp;quot;down&amp;quot; function of the joystick finally gave up on me, after intermitting failures the past month. The only way to select the next menu item was to go &amp;quot;up&amp;quot; through all menu items. It became a pain to use, so I needed a new one.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->With so many phones on the market, the only right way for me to make a selection is to think about what I need in a phone. Last Thursday I sat down to write down the list:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * No &amp;quot;Joystick&amp;quot; as with the T910, it failed way to early and maybe that's because of the construction. The joystick sticks out, and gets a beating when the phone is at the bottom of a pile.
* Has to be absolutely compatible with [Apple's iSync](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/isync/), I don't want to re-type my 107 contacts into a phone. (This practically only leaves Sony Ericcson and Nokia as contestants)
* Has to have bluetooth
* Has to be a &amp;quot;candybar&amp;quot; (no hinges or sliders which can break, answer a phonecall with the push of a button)
* Has to be simlock-free
* Can not be too expensive (200 euro's maximum, but under 100 is better)
* Can not be a Samsung because of their wierd menu structures and ugly UI design
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I went to tweakers.net, and used the pricewatch functionality to search for Sony Ericsson and Nokia phones, starting at 60 euro's and up, meeting the requirements from my list. This was a great excersise, it prevents you from buying a phone which in the top of the sponsored Google search.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found this nice &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_6300">Nokia 6300&lt;/a>, but the thing was, that it seemed not to be supported by iSync. I noticed some people had gotten it to work because it seems that only the model number is missing in the iSync plist files. The Nokia 6300 is a &amp;quot;40's series&amp;quot; firmware and perfectly compatible with iSync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I could have gotten a slightly cheaper model, but I selected the Nokia 6300 because it had another nice feature: it has a standard mini-USB plug, and a micro SD slot, which enables it to double as a memory-stick. Nice. That also means that I don't need extra software to move stuff onto or off of the phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The online price for a Simlock free Nokia 6300 is &lt;a href="http://www.2call.nl/telefoons_detail.php?ID=455">EUR 149,- including taxes&lt;/a>. I thought I'd save some time and went to a few local phoneshops. The only shop where I could get it simlock free was at the &amp;quot;T for telecom&amp;quot; shop, and they had the balls to charge EUR 280,- for it. So I ordered it online and waited patiently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, I found a good Nokia 6300 site, which provides a &lt;a href="http://nokia6300.net/22/nokia-6300-isync-and-leopard">free Nokia 6300 iSync plugin &lt;/a>which allows the Nokia 6300 to sync with iSync. I installed it, and it works flawlessly. 20 minutes after the delivery guy rang the doorbell, my Nokia 6300 is paired with my Mac Mini, and all my contacts are on the phone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nice tip: I also moved the &lt;a href="http://www.adiumxtras.com/index.php?a=xtras&amp;amp;xtra_id=602">&amp;quot;Tokyo Trainstation&amp;quot;&lt;/a> audio set for Adium onto the phone. These make for great unobtrusive ringtones. Normally my phone has no ringtone at all (vibrate only) but the vibrate function of the Nokia 6300 is a bit weaker than the Sony Ericsson T610.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. I also noticed that he shop I ordered my phone from has the &lt;a href="http://www.2call.nl/telefoons_detail.php?ID=628">simlock free iPhone&lt;/a> in stock, although a bit pricey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSX 10.5.2 Solved SMB problems (for me)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/16/1052-solved-smb-problems-for-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2008 20:47:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/16/1052-solved-smb-problems-for-me/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/osx-1051-update-still-smb-problems/">previous post&lt;/a> on this blog, I indicated that the 10.5.1. update of Apple's OSX did not fix my network and SMB problems with my Iomega drive. In the comments underneath, some readers kindly pointed out that &lt;a href="http://download.iomega.com/english/storcenter_home_firmware-k104w11.bin">Iomega's K104w11 Firmware update&lt;/a> is available for the Iomega drive I have. Now that 10.5.2 is out, I reconnected the Iomega drive to my network. And suddenly the world changed...&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I didn't upgrade the drive, because I thought that was rediculous. It works with Windows, it works with Tiger, why shouldn't it work with Leopard? Right now I'm glad that I didn't go through the trouble of upgrading my drive:
&lt;p>With the OSX release 10.5.2, my Iomega drive is accesable, and I can drag files on and off as I like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have created a &amp;quot;sparse bundle&amp;quot; disk image on the drive, so that I can copy files onto it which are bigger than 4GB, and have (very very) long names. So it's finally there: A network mounted 500GB HPS+ partition to which I can backup my backups using an rsync script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that everything works, I might even be tempted to do that Iomega software upgrade, but then again: &amp;quot;if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next thing on my list to find out: What if I upgraded my Tiger fileserver to Leopard, and had TimeMachine running there. Could I rsync the TimeMachine disk to an off-site location without sending the double-hardlinked files twice?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drachten open for Dragracing in 2008!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/11/drachten-open-for-dragracing-in-2008/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2008 21:15:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/11/drachten-open-for-dragracing-in-2008/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This morning I thought I had way too much tasks, way too much paper on my desk, a messy inbox, and a cluttered schedule. Then I made a terrible mistake: try to solve this with more tools. You don't always solve &amp;quot;more X&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;more Y&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I remembererd a discussion about ["remember the milk"](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/), a free online todo list with all kinds of taggin, grouping, mailing and Googletalk features. I registered, and happily set of pouring my life into the thing... or so I thought.
&lt;p>As it turns out, it is extremely hard to grasp the user interface of this thing. After registering I was apperently in the &amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot; mode without knowing it. This prevented me from adding tags to tasks for some strange reason. After I found out that I was in the wrong mode, I went to &amp;quot;Overview&amp;quot;. This gives you the tasks for today, tomorow and next week. If you've added tasks without a date, these will not show up here, which is really annoying. There's also no way to add tasks in this view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To add tasks in the other screens or groups, you need to remember keyboard shortcuts to get to the functionality you want. There are some links which can do the trick, but for some reason they are not in a logical place. Combined with a very wierd &amp;quot;mouse over&amp;quot; mode where you can only see details of a task when moving your mousepointer over the task, this userinterface really isn't user friendly in my opinion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most irritating, and perhaps even killer &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot;: Marking tasks as &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; is not done by clicking on a &amp;quot;finished&amp;quot; button on the task, but by tick-marking them, and then pusing a button on the top of the screen. I actually had too look for the button for 5 minutes before I worked out how I could finish the task. On my paper todo list, a tickmark marks it as &amp;quot;done&amp;quot;. In Remember The Milk, a tickmark has a whole different meaning and that really bothers me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all I spent 30 minutes with Remember The Milk, I managed to create 1 extra folder, add 5 tasks in the user interface, and 1 task by mail, and tag 3 of them. Then I decided that a todo list should not have a learning curve at all. In addition, I realized that adding this tool would add to my things to do, namely transferring and constantly synchronizing my work into this tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I returned to my trusty paper throw-away todo list, and my paper filofax, and realized again that these work best. I also found out that there are more people realizing this. Take a look at &lt;a href="http://zenhabits.net/2007/07/simplifying-david-allens-complicated-gtd-setup/">this interisting article&lt;/a> at zenhabits.net. Sometimes, GTD just adds to yor work, in stead of getting the original work done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Focus. Don't let the shiny tools distract you from your actual work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrate CVS repository to GForge</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/05/migrate-cvs-repository-to-gforge/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2008 20:26:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/03/05/migrate-cvs-repository-to-gforge/</guid><description>
&lt;p>At work we were testdriving &lt;a href="http://www.collab.net/products/sfee/new_4.4.html">SourceForge Enterprise Edition&lt;/a>. It is a great system to keep all your project information, source code, documents, bug reports and changes together, and linked. As you may have noticed, the pricing model of the Enterprise Edition is a well kept secret on the site. Our management bargained with the Colabnet people, but the costs (or TCO) were way to steep to keep SourceForge as our main system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another product which promises to do almost the same thing is &lt;a href="http://gforgegroup.com/es/">GForge Advanced Server&lt;/a>. GForge originally started as a fork of the (then open source) SourceForge code, and is not as advanced as SourceForge is today. But their pricing is more to the likings of our financial people, and we decided it has a good tradeoff between function and price.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said all this, we need to migrate a few projects from SourceForge to GForge. If you'd like to know how to do this, this article is for you. It describes how to get your CVS repository into GForge in 6 steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: Disabling writer access to CVS in SourceForge&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be on the safe side, block write access to the CVS repository to prevent people from committing (and loosing) changes. You can block access using the settings in your SourceForge project, or modifying the &lt;a href="http://ximbiot.com/cvs/manual/cvs-1.11.22/cvs_2.html#SEC36">&amp;quot;writers&amp;quot; file&lt;/a> to the CVSROOT of your repository. If you're not migrating from a SourceForge machine, you'll probably want to use the latter method.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 2: Getting the modules from SourceForge&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log into your SourceForge server, go to the root of the CVS tree for your project. In our example, we'll use &amp;quot;project1&amp;quot; and the modules &amp;quot;modulefoo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;modulebar&amp;quot; (for the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_bar">foobar&lt;/a> minded). An example ssh session will look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>[root@projects /]# cd /cvsroot/project1
[root@projects project1]# ls -al
drwxrws--- 10 nobody reps1010 4096 Mar 4 20:12 .
drwxr-sr-x 10 root root 4096 Feb 20 13:59 ..
drwxrwsr-x 3 nobody reps1010 4096 Dec 28 14:23 CVSROOT
drwxrwsr-x 6 nobody reps1010 4096 Mar 4 14:26 modulefoo
drwxrwsr-x 5 nobody reps1010 4096 Mar 4 14:27 modulebar
[root@projects project1]#
tar -czf project1.tar.gz modulefoo modulebar
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that we do not put the CVSROOT in the tar file. This prevents us from overwriting the CVSROOT later on in the GForge repository. After building the tar file, we need to send it to the GForge machine. You can do this by a secure copy. Put the tar file in the home directory of the user you're using to connect to GForge during the copy. We'll move it later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remove the tar file from the SourceForge server and disconnect. We're done at the SourceForge server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: Add CVS to your GForge project&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need a project to host our sourcefiles (and more). Using a web browser, connect to your GForge machine and create a project, or use an existing one if you've allready done so. Now go into the &amp;quot;Admin&amp;quot; tab of the project, and select &amp;quot;CVS repository&amp;quot; as your scm (Source Code Management) and press Submit:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-3a.png" alt="Add CVS SCM to GForge">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After you've done this, you should have a proper CVS repository set up on your GForge server, in which we can unpack the tarfile we've just created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 4: Unpack the tar file on the GForge machine&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this example, I'm using the root user for convenience. Depending on your administrator, maybe you're not allowed to be root (for good reason). Should you not have enough permissions to execute any of the following commands in the right locations, ask your administrator to execute Step 4 and 5 for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Log on to the GForge machine, and become root. Move the tar file to the cvsroot location of your project, and unpack the modules there. Your session should look something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>[root@gforge ~]# cd /cvsroot/project1
[root@gforge project1]# mv /home/someuser/project1.tar.gz .
[root@gforge project1]# tar -xzf project1.tar.gz
[root@gforge project1]# rm project1.tar.gz
[root@gforge project1]# ls -al
drwxrws--- 5 nobody project1 4096 Feb 20 14:20 .
drwxr-xr-x 12 root root 4096 Mar 4 19:49 ..
drwxrwsr-x 3 nobody project1 4096 Feb 20 14:19 CVSROOT
drwxrwsr-x 6 nobody 519 4096 Mar 3 11:57 modulefoo
drwxrwsr-x 7 nobody 519 4096 Feb 20 16:14 modulebar
[root@gforge project1]#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>At this point, the modules are in GForge, but we can not access them yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 5: Setting the permissions&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The files and folders in the modules are having the wrong ownership and permissions because they came from a different machine with different users. To be able to set the permissions, we need a username and a group to add to these files. When adding a project in GForge, a group with the same name as the project is also made.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First we need to change the ownership of the files, without touching the CVSROOT:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>chown -R nobody:project1 modulefoo modulebar
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Next, we need to set the permissions of all directories (except for CVSROOT) in the tree. We do this by recursively finding all directories in the modules and executing chmod against them. Type the following on 1 line, exactly as shown:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>find modulefoo modulebar -type d -exec
chmod u+rwx,g+rwxs,o+rx,o-w {} \;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The files have slightly different permissions. You can set these by typing the following on 1 line, exactly as shown:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>find modulefoo modulebar -type f -exec
chmod u+r,u-wx,g+r,g-wxs,o+r,o-wx {} \;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To check that everything has worked, take a look at the file and directory permissions of modulefoo:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>[root@gforge project1]# ls -al modulefoo
drwxrwsr-x 6 nobody project1 4096 Mar 3 11:57 .
drwxrws--- 5 nobody project1 4096 Feb 20 14:20 ..
drwsrwsr-x 2 nobody project1 4096 Feb 20 14:20 Attic
-r--r--r-- 1 nobody project1 16330 Mar 3 11:57 build.properties,v
-r--r--r-- 1 nobody project1 15195 Mar 3 11:57 .cvsignore,v
...
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 6: Restart and Check GForge Access&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CVS access will now work, but in GForge you will get an error in the CVS browser. To get rid of this error you need to restart apache. As root, do:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cd /etc/init.d
apachectl restart
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Close your ssh session. Open your browser and go to your GForge server. Open your project, and click on the &amp;quot;CVS&amp;quot; tab on the right. You should now see the root of the project, with modulefoo and modulebar as folders in a list. Congratulations, you're done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should you get the dreaded &amp;quot;Python error&amp;quot; with some rubbish text about not having enough permissions, you did not restart apache, or something went wrong while setting the file permissions and ownershisps. Double check them, and make sure you didn't touch the CVSROOT directory, or the current or parent directories. If you did, simply &lt;a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Immaculate_Backup_.aspx">restore from your backup&lt;/a> and retry :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun migrating your projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When "J" means ":-)"</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/27/when-j-means/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Feb 2008 13:14:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/27/when-j-means/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Lately I've been recieving mails with the letter &amp;quot;J&amp;quot; in seemingly random places. At first I thought I had gotten old, the world around me changed and people were starting to replace the smileys with single letter J's. I thought it meant &amp;quot;Joke&amp;quot; and carried on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I noticed other people being puzzled by the J's aswell, so I thought I'd find out where the J's come from. It actually turns out to be a technical problem when using Microsoft Outlook to send smileys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Microsoft translates a &amp;quot;:-)&amp;quot; into a smiley character from the wingdings font. When the mail is sent, the character encoding of the mail screws everything up and by the time that I recieve the mail in Thunderbird it has become a &amp;quot;J&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until Microsoft solves this, try to refrain from using smileys, or turn off the &amp;quot;show emoticons as icons&amp;quot; feature.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GForge CVS/SSH Authentication Failures</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/26/gforge-cvsssh-authentication-failures/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Feb 2008 10:48:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/26/gforge-cvsssh-authentication-failures/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Recently we had a problem connecting to our GForge CVS through SSH. We added the public RSA key to the GForge user, but because of wrong configuration on the client we tried to connect a couple of times with the wrong key. After a while the GForge CVS will return the following error:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Received disconnect from &lt;GForge ip>: 2: Too many authentication failures for &lt;username>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To solve this, simple ask a GForge administrator to edit the GForge user, and press the &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot; button without changing anything. You will be able to reconnect immediately after the administrator has pressed &amp;quot;Save&amp;quot;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Link CVS/SVN commit to GForge Tracker Item</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/21/link-cvssvn-commit-to-gforge-tracker-item/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Feb 2008 12:47:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/21/link-cvssvn-commit-to-gforge-tracker-item/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today I spent some time figuring out what the exact format of the CVS comment is when I want to link a commit to a GForge tracker item. I'll try to explain it a bit simpler:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * We have [GForge](http://gforge.org/) installed at work. We use GForge to manage a software project for a customer.
* The customer reports a bug in the Tracker of GForge. This bug gets assigned to me.
* I read the code, find the problem and fix it. Now I want to commit the fix to the GForge integrated CVS, and have it automatically linked to the Tracker item for future reference.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I spent 30 minutes Googling for an example, and did find a lot of info, but no real usage examples. The info says &amp;quot;Include the tracker item id in the commit comment&amp;quot;. I spent anther 10 to 20 minutes trying to figure out if this meant just the number, the number with the prefix, or brackets, or both. To save more people from searching, you should copy-paste the complete tracker id from the tracker item screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Example:**
&lt;p>To connect a CVS commit to Tracker Item 123, use the following comment:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>cvs commit xyz.txt &lt;em>&amp;quot;This is a commit comment for &lt;strong>[#123]&lt;/strong> in GForge project XYZ&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GForge will then automatically link the commit to the tracker item(s). You can have multiple item id's in there, and you can also do multiple commits for a single tracker item.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another great tip:Â  Enable the &amp;quot;Require Tracker Item ID on commit&amp;quot; to force people to do this. Then, create a seperate tracker item titled &amp;quot;Generic Work&amp;quot; so that people who are NOT working on a specific Tracker kan still commit. This forces people to think about what thei're committing for.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One step further would be to have a seperate tracker item for &amp;quot;refactoring&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;configuration management&amp;quot; or have todo tracker items for a release. This way you can link commits to certain types of work, maybe even to a time tracking tool.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Time Machine to the Rescue</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/21/time-machine-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2008 20:54:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/21/time-machine-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Hi, I just wanted to share with you that I actually recovered a mail item which I had written in Thunderbird for Windows with Time Machine. Yes, Apple's &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/backup-guru-give-me-a-break/">Time Machine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->At work, we use Windows XP machines. Because I hate to wait 4 weeks for my mail program to load, I use [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/nl/products/thunderbird/). When I'm on the road, I ocasionally use webmail access, so I have Thunderbird setup so that it connects to the mailserver using [IMAP](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol). By doing this, my mail is always on the mail server.
&lt;p>Last week I saved a Draft mail containing some bugs in an application. My intention was to update this mail all week with new bugs, and send it out by the end of the week so that the reciever had a neat little list. By the end of the week however, I noticed that my Drafts folder was containing all kinds of old mail, and I decided to clean it out by &amp;quot;Crtl-A&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Delete&amp;quot;. I went home with an empty Drafts folder, not realizing I had also deleted the Draft mail with the list of bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By Sunday, I decided to send out the mail with the list of Bugs, and before I touched a computer it had hit me: I had deleted all my drafts! I sat down behind my trusty Mac Mini, settled on re-typing the whole list, but then I had a brilliant idea. My Apple runs Leopard, and the Mail program also connects through IMAP to the mailserver at work. So without me noticing, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html">Mail.app&lt;/a> had been fetching my mail all week, and Time Machine had been making backups all week. So I navigated to the &amp;quot;Drafts&amp;quot; folder, pressed the Time Machine icon, and 2 simple mouseclicks later I had found and restored that email I deleted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sent it out and needless to say I am a very happy camper. Today was a bit less succesful, I forgot to sleep my Apple so Mail.app was periodically fetching my mail. At work, Thunderbird disconnects when that happens so I was constantly re-connecting while reading and writing mail. Oh well, at least everything is backed up :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SVN is missing the point?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/16/svn-is-missing-the-point/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2008 18:54:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/02/16/svn-is-missing-the-point/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Our company was using Rational Clearcase for version control about 6 years ago. The developers decided it was way to clunky, error prone and WAY too expensive. We introduced CVS and it has been working fine for a few years now. CVS is widely known, stable and simple. I looked into using SVN a few years ago but the clients were unusable at that time. This year, the SVN discussion came to life again and some of my collegues started playing with it after I mentioned it as being a step forward from CVS.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->We've been using GForge for a few weeks now as an environment to keep all the project information in one place. In the light of the migration discussion from our old environment, SVN was considered because it promised to "solve" a few things for us:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Placing a tag on a very large (3GB) repository can be very quick
* Updating the local copy takes less bandwith than with CVS, meaning improved performance when working remotely over a poor connection
* SVN claims to keep the history information when moving or renaming a file (although I think that only applies if you use an SVN client to do the rename/move)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now that we've converted/started a few projects in SVN, we find that SVN is maybe not an improvement over CVS after all. The SVN designers have overlooked a few very important things which professional users absolutely need. We had the following problems with SVN:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * There is no default eclipse integration. The Subclipse plugin behaves erratic and buggy. Subversive comes with a few SVN adapters of which we are not sure which to pick. The developer side of the SVN/eclipse combo does not work &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot;, which adds to setup time and therefore costs money.
* Finding all the revisions and branches of a file is hard in SVN. It requires manually browsing the repository branches and doing compares. For multiple files, this requires major knowledge of SVN and it's tools. Needless to say, that also adds to development time, and therefore costs money.
* Merging branches into the trunk is complicated and requires serious manual administration on the end user side as compared to CVS, see also previous bullet.
* trunk, branches and versions are part of the directory structure. This seems a bit odd to me, because a versioning system should not interfere with my directory structure. We had a lengthy discussion on how to call and place the &amp;quot;trunk&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;branch&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;tag&amp;quot; directories. At the time it sounded good to talk about, but the more I think about it, it seems completely wrong alltogether to me. The version of a file is determined by its place in a tree? That is just plain wierd.
* branches and tags are the same thing in SVN. This means that one could modify a tagged file, and nobody would notice without manual checking. This came as a complete surprise to me. We use CVS tags to tag software versions, and do production support based on those tags.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From all the discussion and experiences with SVN on some projects, I think I need to re-think my position on SVN. It suddenly doesn't seem al that promising to me. CVS does have it flaws, but because it is fairly simple, we have simple workarounds and fixes for each of them. The bandwith problem is easier solved with a better connection, and finding the history of a renamed file can be solved by having a good comment in the odd ocasion that one needs to rename or move a file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>SVN positions itself as a CVS replacement, and it had me fooled for a while, but it is really not all that good from an end users perspective. I really don't see the point of having a revision of the whole repository state, as opposed to having a version per file. That, and the fact that a lot of the SVN promises only hold up if you use the command-line SVN client, makes SVN a very weak competitor to the widely used, accepted and stable CVS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot of rants and flames on the net about people having problems because thy &amp;quot;miss atomic commits&amp;quot; for instance. In the past 20 years of my career, they number of problems arising from commits not being atomic was not big. Most of the problems were people doing partial commits, which they could easily also have done with SVN. Most problems are not because of a tool, but because of the humans that use it, and the natural habbit of humans of making mistakes. Atomic commits solves a theoretical problem which does not lead to big problems in CVS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The more I think about it, SVN seems to be a nerd's implementation to a theoretical problem, whereas CVS is a pragmatic solution to a real life situation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Maps Improved?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/29/google-maps-improved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jan 2008 22:10:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/29/google-maps-improved/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="wake-up-face.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Philips Wake-up Light">
With the &amp;quot;Wake-up Light&amp;quot;, Philips has taken the &amp;quot;dawn simulator&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;alternative/hippie&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;trendy&amp;quot;. Cleverly marketing it as simply a pleasant way to wake up, making it available in many stores and adding &amp;quot;trendy&amp;quot; pricing, Philips has a lot of people looking into one of these. But is it worth the money?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**What is a Wake-up Light?**
&lt;p>The Wake-up light can be categorized as a &amp;quot;dawn simulator&amp;quot;. Dawn simulators are nothing more than an alarm clock with the ability to slowly increase the intensity of an attached lightbulb. Dawn simulators generally take 30 minutes to reach 100% light intensity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Why do I need a Wake-up Light? **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several reasons why you would want to by a Wake-up Light. These range from simply being comfortable waking up to a lit room, to really having problems waking up and staying awake during the day. If you have problems waking up in the dark and have sort of a jetlag feeling all winter, you are categorized as having &amp;quot;SAD&amp;quot; (Seasonal Affective Disorder). Usually this will not be a big problem and dissapear somewhere in the spring. There are some cases where people actually are having problems functioning and/or get into a serious depression, in which case the Wake-up Light is not likely to be helpfull and can even make the problems worse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you are sleeping, you go through various &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep">sleeping phases&lt;/a>. Some of these phases are easier to wake up from than others. When the Wake-up light slowly lightens your room, chances are that somewhere in that halfhour, you reach a phase in which you are easier to wake up. In this phase you'll note the light and feel like you've &amp;quot;naturally&amp;quot; woken (assuming you've had a normal night's rest). This will feel a lot better than your alarm clock suddenly going &amp;quot;BEEP-BEEP&amp;quot; at full volume, scaring the crap out of you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There's also another, more scientific fact. The day-night rythm, or &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm">&amp;quot;Circadian rythm&amp;quot;&lt;/a> of your body is regulated by your &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus">Hypothalamus&lt;/a> which is located in your head, just above your brain stem. This organ regulates several metabolic processes and controls production of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin">Melatonin&lt;/a> in the evening and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortisol">Cortisol&lt;/a> in the morning. The day-night rythm is partially controled by the dark/light cycle of daylight. When traveling to different timezones, your body can have trouble resetting the Circadiam rythm, contributing to jetlag. In space, Astronouts are helped to keep this rythm by artificial day/night light simulation inside the spacecrafts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To keep the Circadian rythm in sync with your daily activities, even when there is no light, you need to do two things, one of which is hard. The first and easiest thing you can do is buy a Wake-up Light and set it to wake you every day at the same time, even in the weekends. The second, harder, thing to do is try to refrain from staring into bright lightsources before you are going to sleep. This means no staring at computer screens or TV's. By staring at your white computer screen, your body will delay the production of Melatonin. By the time you need to wake up, there's still too much Melatonin in your body, and the Cortisol will not work or not even produced. This will give you that &amp;quot;Why did you wake me in the middle of the night&amp;quot; feeling in the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Does the Wake-up Light use a special Lightbulb?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No. The Philips Wake-up Light uses a normal Softone T55 &amp;quot;warm white&amp;quot; lightbulb, and it seems to work fine for a lot of people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="neodymium-a21-bulb.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Neodymium A51 Bulb">
Many dawn-simulator manufacturers believe in the exact reproduction of daylight, and ship their devices with &lt;a href="http://members.misty.com/don/oddbulb.html#nd">Neodymium lightbulbs&lt;/a>. These bulbs claim to have a more faithful reproduction of daylight, and are believed to be the best bulbs to use in dawn simulators. Neodymium bulbs look purple to clear blue when turned off. If you really want to, you can replace the bulb in the Wake-up Light with a Neodymium bulb of the same power. &lt;a href="http://www.toolsforwellness.com/verilux.html">Verilux&lt;/a> makes some nice bright daylight blubs, one of which is in my old &lt;a href="http://www.lumie.com/shop/products/dawn-simulators/Bodyclock-SUNRAY-100">Lumie Sunray 100 Bodyclock&lt;/a>. &lt;a href="http://art-craft-uk.daylightcompany.com/store/bulbs-tubes-3">Daylight(tm)&lt;/a> also produces Neodymium bulbs, but these are generally darker than the Verilux ones because of the thicker blue coatings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Product look and feel&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Besides waking you up in the morning, you also want a nice looking device, good audio quality, build quality and ease of use. I'm afraid the Wake-up Light does not score all that well in that department. The most important thing to note is that the Wake-up Light is miles ahead of it's competitors from the &amp;quot;alternative&amp;quot; sector, where &amp;quot;usability&amp;quot; is generally translated into &amp;quot;ugly&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;clunky&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;robust&amp;quot; is translated into, well, &amp;quot;ugly&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;clunky&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="wake-up-snooze.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Turn off the light">
Although it is better than the competition in terms of it's looks and features, there are a few things which need mentioning. The most important thing being the way you control the alarm when you've just woken up. In the morning you're probably not at your best, so finding a tiny knob you can't see on the top of a device which is almost out-of-reach can be frustrating. The &amp;quot;snooze&amp;quot; button is on the top and can easily be &amp;quot;found&amp;quot; by slapping your hand anywhere on the top of the light. Resetting the alarm takes a bit more control, you need to find one of the 4 buttons on the top of the device. Judging from Philip's own advertisement pictures (shown here on the right), this button is clearly not within your field of vision when lying in your bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other buttons are located on the front of the base and allow you to control the brightness of the light and the volume of the radio or other sounds you choose when waking up. The processor in the Wake-up Light is a very-very slow one, because after pushing a button will take a while before the device reacts. This is very irritating for a device of well over a 100 Euros. When choosing an alarm sound, you can not go click-click-click to switch to the third. The Wake-up Light makes you listen to the sound before accepting a new click. Very irritating.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are no radio-presets. This would be not a big problem if the radio would be scanning stations fast, but that's not the case. To scan the whole band for a suitable radio station will take a lot of button presses, and a lot of time (5 minutes is not uncommon). Without presets,switching between stations which are far apart in radio-frequency terms will take a lot of time and frustration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When pressing the buttons, there is a very cheap plastic feel to them, and you have to push them relatively hard before they make the cheap &amp;quot;click&amp;quot; sound.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other irritating &amp;quot;design features&amp;quot; include the fact that it does not make a difference between your alarm settings and the things you do to the clock when listening to the radio or reading a book. Say you want to wake up to light intensity &amp;quot;10&amp;quot; (it goes from 0 to 20) and the radio at volume &amp;quot;6&amp;quot;. You set the alarm accordingly. After setting the alarm, you decide to read a book before going to bed. When you turn the light up to 20 to read your book, and turn up the volume of the radio, you are in for a surprise the next morning... The Wake-up light will use intensity 20 and whatever radio volume your clock was last set to. I circumvented this by having a reading light and using a seperate radio.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most dawn-simulators have a mode where they also do a &amp;quot;dusk&amp;quot; simulation, slowly turning down the light while you fall asleep. If you have any form of SAD, this is not a good feature to use because of the day/night rythm discussed earlier. With the Wake-up Light, you don't even have the choice. It can only wake you up, but not put you to sleep. No features whatsoever. No sleep mode on the radio, no sleep mode on the light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A really nice feature is the &amp;quot;preview&amp;quot; button where the Wake-up light shows you what is going to happen next morning, but than in a &amp;quot;fast forward&amp;quot; mode. It goes through the whole wakeup process in 90 seconds, so you can see and hear if you set it up correctly. Do not forget to push the button again after you're ready, because it repeats the preview indefinetely. I would find it more obvious to do 1 preview on each button press.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In preview mode, I noticed that the intensity of the light does not increase perfectly. At some points, the light intensity seems to decrease briefly. I also noticed this in the 30-minute cycle in the morning, although it is not irritating. I think this has to do with the built-in dimmer frequency interfering with the 50Hz of the mains, and is a slight design flaw.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The funniest of all was the fact that after spending by 119 Euros, I found out that there was only a German and Italian quick-start card in the box, and no trace of a usermanual. The manual is available as a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/01/22/philips-wake-up-light-hf356001-manual/">seperate download&lt;/a>. It's strange to see that Philips assumes that everybody who buys an alarm clock also owns a computer and has an internet connection.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Beep-Beep?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the Wake-up Light has turned up the light, it will start the audio alarm you selected at the volume you selected (and the time you selected). Thank god Philips has banned the terrible 50Hz buzzer &amp;quot;beep-beep&amp;quot; sound in this one. The waking sounds available on the 100Watt HF3461 model are:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>radio - Plays your chosen station.
birds - An approx. 20 second looping sample of tjirping birds in a quiet surrounding.
forest - 20 second loop of animal sounds in a forrest.
sea - 20 second loop of the sea washing against the shore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All sounds will start on a low volume, and slowly increase to the volume you selected before you went to sleep.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>400 Lumen or not?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two general versions of the Wake-up Light. A 75 Watt without, and a 100 Watt with radio. The 100 Watt model is claimed to put out 400 &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_%28unit%29">Lumen&lt;/a> (not to be confused with &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux">Lux&lt;/a>) at the highest setting (20). Although the Wake-up Light will always produce the same light (aging of the bulb not considered), you will notice that you will not wake up to the same &amp;quot;light sensation&amp;quot; each morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="wake-up-position.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Waking up in the shade">
According to the manual, you need to place your Wake-up Light about 30-40 cm from your head, in such a way that your pillow will not block the light. Even when doing this, there is about a 50% chance that you are not facing the bodyclock in the morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I bought my Lumie bodyclock in 2005, I noticed after a while I automatically wake up facing the lamp. It seems I like bright light, even when I sleep ;-) For that matter, the Wake-up Light is brighter than my Lumie (100 vs 60 Watt), so that's an improvement I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the &lt;a href="http://www.wakeuplight.philips.nl/">Wake-up Light&lt;/a> is a step in the right direction, but it's not there yet. If you like slowly waking up to a simulated sunrise, or are having trouble waking up in the winter, this one is for you, provided you can spend the whopping 119 Euro's I payed for the 100Watt version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'd really like to see a version where I can connect external lightsources and have my &lt;a href="http://www.builderssquare.com/xp_4465732-Craftsman_500_watt_Tripod_Light_with_Portable_Stand_WL500SPT_S.aspx">500Watt Halogen lamp&lt;/a> slowly light the whole room.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Philips Wake-up Light HF3461/01 Manual</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/22/philips-wake-up-light-hf356001-manual/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2008 21:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/22/philips-wake-up-light-hf356001-manual/</guid><description>
&lt;p>For some strange reason, Philips doesn't provide you with a manual when you buy a Wake-up light. For those of you who want to download the full manual, you can do so by browsing through the directory at:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.p4c.philips.com/files/h/hf3461_01/">http://www.p4c.philips.com/files/h/hf3461_01/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The filenames are a bit strange, but looking at the last three letters in the filename will generaly give you a manual containing the language you can read. (&amp;quot;fra&amp;quot; for France, &amp;quot;nld&amp;quot; for the Netherlands, etc.). The Manuals describe the models HF3451, HF3461 and HF3462.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny detail: After downloading the manual and opening it, it says &lt;em>&amp;quot;Read this manual carefully before using this device&amp;quot;&lt;/em>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Macworld 2008 thin as air</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/17/macworld-2008-thin-as-air/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2008 20:59:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/17/macworld-2008-thin-as-air/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Hi, I've read the writeups on Steve's keynote this year, and listened to some podcasts of people who were in the audience. Personally I'm a bit dissapointed by the features introduced at this Macworld. Surely it's hard to live up to the ever rising expectations every year, but I do have some comments to make on the introduced products.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**TimeCapsule**
&lt;p>This is the worst product Apple has introduced in years. Not that it's crappy hardware or a lousy idea, but the way they are artificially forcing you to buy their $299 500GB harddrive (0r $499 for the 1TB version) in stead of the 100's of readily available, $150 to $200 cheap ethernet connected harddrives out there which would perfectly perform this task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Quick tip: Should you have an Ethernet connected FAT32 drive on which you want timemachine to run, create a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_disk_image">sparse disk image&lt;/a> on that disk (no need to commandline, can also be done with the disk utility). A sparse disk image is effectively a DMG file in 8MB chunks. You can mount that DMG file and have a network connected (strong encrypted if you like), HFS+ journalled drive. After the &lt;a href="http://andreas.louca.org/2007/11/10/time-machine-and-network-drives/">Timemachine network trick&lt;/a>, you're probably good to go at no cost at all. The only difference is that you can't connect your printer to that drive. Well I have my Airport extreme for that, which also streams audio to my stereo.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Macbook air&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Very cool looking laptop with lots of potential for journalists and the occasional &lt;a href="http://www.ijustine.tv/">life blogger&lt;/a>, but I have some doubts about the intended audience. The most obvious is the lack of a CD/DVD drive. This is not a big problem for most users, and with the added tools to connect to any DVD drive on a remote Windows or Apple machine it will not be as big as a problem as one would think. For my wife this is a no-go, she watches DVD's on her laptop, so she's not getting this Macbook air anytime soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next problem is the configuration options. The cheap model is a 1.3GHz machine, 2GB memory and 80GB Harddrive. It is priced at $1799, which is pretty steep compared to a normal Macbook. For $700 less, you can get a 2.0GHz macbook with a combo drive, which is much nicer in my opinion. Should you want the Macbook air and have a heftier processor, you're in for a surprise. The 1.8GHz model (still not as fast as the cheapest macbook) is priced at a staggering $3098! This is not because of the processor, but it contains a 64GB flash-based harddrive. Less storage space, but more battery life and crash-resistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with the 1.8GHz model of the Macbook air is that you effectively get a smaller harddrive, a marginally better processor, for $3098. Compared to that, for $2799, you can get the 17&amp;quot; Macbook pro at 2.4 GHz, with a superdrive. I know what I would get. Additionaly, the 64GB flash-based drive has a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_state_disk#Disadvantages">limited amount of write-cycles&lt;/a>. This means that the solid state drive will probably wear out faster than any cheap traditional HD in the market. Based on the write cycles, a normal HD will likely last 5 times longer than a flash-based disk under the same circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need a really thin laptop with good battery life for simple word processing, or simply something to match your gucci wardrobe and your &lt;a href="http://www.owensworld.com/funnyimages/files/I_beat_anorexia_big.jpg">perfect figure&lt;/a>, get the Macbook air. If you need anything marginally better, go for the normal macbook, which is still in my opinion the best value for money and a darn cool, acceptably thin and very portable laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, the Macbook air is a no-go even if it was priced at $1000. Why? **IT HAS NO ETHERNET!**What were they thinking? Many companies have wired-only policies because of security and troughput reasons. This means you can't take your Macbook air to the office for the occasional showing off. It's helpless in a wired-only environment. No DVD, and no means of connecting to the network?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Macbook air becomes a succes, Apple is clearly into some voodoo-market-magic because I don't get it. It also doesn't have Audio in, to put off the mobile podcasters or radio journalists out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Apple TV&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;quot;all new&amp;quot; software for the Apple TV is very cool for people who already own an Apple TV. It looks like a big improvement, and not needing a PC or Mac is a step in the right direction. No need to explain &amp;quot;syncing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;connecting&amp;quot; to newcommers, just plug and play. Nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The missing thing here is that they could have chosen to make the Apple TV the TimeCapsule. It has a harddrive, USB ports, and wifi. Why do I need another machine with anothe power brick if I have a harddisk onderneath my TV which is doing nothing 80% of it's time? Selling a 1TB Apple TV with a smart disk usage policy would make much more sense to me. As an added benefit, people who are looking for a backup solution get sucked into the &amp;quot;Movie Rentals&amp;quot; scheme on the go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>One missing thing:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The iPhone. It was mentioned, but still I was expecting 2 major announcements. The first, and most obvious announcement would be a 16 or 32 GB model. This was anticipated to happen for over a year now, but it didn't. I think it's not that big of a deal because I have a 8GB nano and it stores more than enough music to listen to in between syncs. Just use &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/ipod-synchronization-techniques/">really smart playlists&lt;/a> and iTunes will take care of it for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I missed was the introduction of the iPhone in more European countries. Hello Apple, Europe doesn't consist of Great Brittain, France and Germany alone! Over here in the Netherlands, a lot of people have hacked grey import iPhones because they are dying to buy one, but can't get it legally. Maybe Apple thinks it's done beccause they reached their targets, but I think they are missing out on a big market of wealthy (west-) European consumers easily wanting to pay for the legal version of the iPhone, no matter which provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To top that, the free software update for the iPhone will cost $20 dollars for iPod touch owners, while new iPod touch's will have that included for free. I wonder what &amp;quot;marketing genius&amp;quot; is behind that. It almost looks like Steve has been on a year's vacation, leaving business to somebody else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just noticed that the complete video of the keynote is online at &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/&lt;/a>. Have fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Edit:Â  I see that there is an USB Ethernet adapter and an external DVD drive available as options to the Macbook air. But still, I think the ethernet port should be in there, I don't want to have to carry all kinds of adapters with my Macbook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Irritating "Features": Philips Matchline TV</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/17/irritating-features-phillips-matchline-tv/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2008 20:11:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/17/irritating-features-phillips-matchline-tv/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Okay, I have to get this out of my system. It is something I've been complaining about for months, and it is really an example of the utter dumbness of some product designers. What am I talking about? Simply turning on my TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have this very nice big heavy 100Hz 4:3 Phillips Matchline TV, which I bought 8 or so years ago. For that time, it was a feature-rich TV which could store all kinds of user settings through on-screen menus, and keep them stored even when the power went out. A few weeks ago I noticed a new TV at a friends house has the same &amp;quot;feature&amp;quot; as my old Matchline. You can't turn it on!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What happens? Monday evening, you are done watching TV and use the remote to switch it to &amp;quot;Stand By&amp;quot; mode. Before you go to bed, you walk by the TV and hit the power button to completely turn it off. Now on Tuesday, after dinner, you decide to watch TV. You walk to the TV, hit the power button, and what happens? The TV goes from &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Standby&amp;quot;. What complete and utter IDIOT designs a TV which goes to &amp;quot;standby&amp;quot; after turning it on with the power button? It wouldn't surprise me that a junior programmer was showing off his l33t skills by remembering the state of the TV before it was turned off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, after 8 years of introducing the wierdest features to TV's, the usability labs in this world have still not found the most obvious feature to a TV: Turning it on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Real guitar game: Guitar Wizzard</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/10/real-guitar-game-guitar-wizzard/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jan 2008 21:35:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/10/real-guitar-game-guitar-wizzard/</guid><description>
&lt;p>No, I'm not a guitar player, but I noticed this cool post on TUAW where the &amp;quot;Guitar Hero&amp;quot; game has been taken a notch up. &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/01/09/guitar-wizard-coming-for-mac/">TUAW reports&lt;/a> that the guys at &lt;a href="http://www.musicwizard.com">www.musicwizard.com&lt;/a> have built &lt;a href="http://www.musicwizard.com/guitar_wizard/updates.php">&amp;quot;Guitar Wizzard&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, a game with which you can learn to play popular songs on a &lt;em>real guitar&lt;/em>. From what I can see in the video, this looks way less frustrating than doing the same excersizes over and over to learn to play the guitar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, you might not turn in to Mark Knopfler in a week, but isn't it a much better feeling to hold a real guitar in your hand, in stead of that plasticky, toy-like mini quitar with the bright colored buttons? And the price is about right for a game including hardware aswell.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dakar, 369 days to go...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/05/dakar-369-days-to-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2008 20:45:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/05/dakar-369-days-to-go/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The organization of the Dakar rally has cancelled the rally because some idiots are planning terrorist attacks. Instead of doing a partial rally, or a couple of stages around Lissabon, the complete rally is cancelled. I really think this is unacceptable for all riders, sponsors and TV stations depending on this rally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the time and money people have put into making it to Dakar is wasted. Next year it will be harder to get sponsors for the rally, because the sponsors will not risk investing large amounts of money in a rally which &amp;quot;may or may not&amp;quot; start. All those private riders which loaned money from the bank will have a hard time returning next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although not nearly as bad as for the competitors, this means a lousy start of 2008 for me and a lot of Dakar fans eagerly waiting the start of the rally, which was scheduled tommorow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dakar 2008, 4 days to go.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/01/dakar-2008-4-days-to-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 01:50:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2008/01/01/dakar-2008-4-days-to-go/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Only 4 days until the biggest and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar_Rally">toughest rally in the world&lt;/a> starts in Lisboa. After 2 weeks, on the 20th of Januari, the bikes will finish their trip in Dakar (oh yes, and there will be some cars too, and some uninteresting truckers). The number to keep an eye on (again) this year is bike 041. It's &lt;a href="http://www.dakarsport.com/index.php?quicklink=teams&amp;amp;teamID=11">Miriam Pol&lt;/a>, who is planning on finishing high in the bikes classification.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![Dakar 2008 Schedule, thanks to DakarSport.com](route2008schema.thumbnail.jpg)
&lt;p>](route2008schema.jpg)People who think that trucks are the best, you probably want to stop reading here. Still reading? I will explain why I think bikes are the absolute real rally competitors (yes, your opinion may differ. Start your own blog. Bye).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Trucks&lt;/strong> are the fastest brute-force machines on the track, and the drivers will push other competitors aside. Inside the trucks, 5 people are &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/714390/mister-dakar.html">smoking cigarettes&lt;/a> and sipping coffee while bumping cars off the road at 200km/h on a small sandy road. They arrive at the stops first, have a beer and a good night's sleep, and leave the next morning to shove some more dust in the eyes of other competitors. When interviewed,these &amp;quot;men&amp;quot; will complain about branches, sand, other competirors, the food, the tires, and their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_underwear">longjohns&lt;/a> being too tight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cars&lt;/strong>, the largest group of competitors, are second-fastest on the track, and often have nice fights for position. There are always &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/579212/masuoka-san-ii.html">2 people in a car&lt;/a>, one navigator and one driver. They work together when digging out their car out of the sand dunes, and solve technical problems. High speeds and great driving skills make cars nice to look at for about 5 minutes, I really enjoyed &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/642034/robby-gordon---dakar-2007.html">Robbie Gordon&lt;/a>'s &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/642035/html/">Hummer&lt;/a> last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-3.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.thumbnail.png" alt="Mirjam Pol During Shamrock Rally 2007, Marokko">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Bikes&lt;/strong> are probably the smallest group of competitors. These are in my eyes the only real competitors. They ride their bikes 800km a day through the &lt;a href="dsc_1649.jpg">desert&lt;/a>, 15 hours straight at a time. All roadbook preperations, &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/667416/html/">riding&lt;/a>, navigating and repairs during the tests are done by themselves. When they arrive late at night, they have to prepare the roadbook for the next day, and catch a few hours of sleep. The next morning, they are the earliest starters, returning to the desert with nothing more than their bikes, water, and candybars to eat. During the day, the bikes are passed by cars, and dumbass maniac truckdrivers often making the bikes tip over and leaving them in a ditch besides the road (if not worse).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bike on the right is this year's outfit of Mirjam. Purple bike, and the ever Orange Helmet. Go Mirjam!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Easy Image Resizing in OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/12/31/easy-image-resizing-in-osx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2007 16:24:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/12/31/easy-image-resizing-in-osx/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I've used it, and it works as advertised. Drag a bunch of images on the application, and batch-resize them without touching your originals. You can save the images with a postfix, and even in a different format if you like.

&lt;p>On Christmas day, Santa gave me a very nice book about digital photography, by Michael Freeman. The book contains lots of interesting information and tips for the digital SLR photographer. The only problem with the book is, that the Dutch translation of it is absolutely terrible to read. The sentences do not &amp;quot;flow&amp;quot; naturaly, and almost feel as if they were litteraly translated word-by-word from the English version.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Because the book contains information I'm interested in, I tried a bit harder to read the kindergarten translation method by translating the sentences back to English in my head. Suddenly the book made much more sense. But every now and then, about once every page, the translators use Dutch words which I have never ever heard of, which often aren't even close to the correct translation of the technical term originally used by the author.
&lt;p>An example: On page 23, the dutch word &amp;quot;conjugatie&amp;quot; is used. I never heard of this word so I looked it up in the dictionary, wikipedia and some other online sources. The word seems to be a mostly medical term, and can be a synonym for the Egnlish words &amp;quot;relation&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;connection&amp;quot;. This is realy strange, because the word is used in a text where the focal point is discussed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another example. On page 31, the Dutch term &amp;quot;fotosiet&amp;quot; is used. I couldn't even find a definition of this word, but when searching for the Dutch word &amp;quot;siet&amp;quot;, I found that this word is used mostly in very old scripts, from the year 1700 to 1800, and the word is not used in normal Dutch nowadays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all, John Degen and Ammerins Moss-de-Boer of &amp;quot;Deul &amp;amp; Spanjaard&amp;quot; should give up translating technical photography books like these. It is ruined. I'll try to get an English copy of this book, and maybe even talk to Michael Freeman about the way this book is not fit for the Dutch market in the current translation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hello kids. Yes, if you are writing applications for consumer companies, there's a good chance I'm talking to you. We need to have a talk, urgently. It's about a whole new way of doing things, and it's a new word in your dictionary. The word is &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/secure">secure&lt;/a>&amp;quot; (linked to Webster's for your convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Security is a funny thing. Everybody thinks it's very important, some people think it's a synonym for "complex" and some people avoid it because it's "too much hassle". Most worrying are the people who have online shops and think they can do without, particularly if they think "expensive".
&lt;p>Online shops which started out as simple &amp;quot;sell stuff from the attic&amp;quot; stores, seldom have good data protection in place. The &amp;quot;my expensive server does not need to backup&amp;quot; problem aside, most of the time there's nothing in place preventing hackers from stealing data. If that's the shopkeepers data, that's not a big problem. The problem gets bigger if the shopkeeper stores customer data in his system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most larger shops are often developed by students or hobbyists, who can hack some HTML, or maybe even PHP and MySQL. In a short time, a shop is up and running, the student is payed a small amount and the shopkeeper is happy. The forms in the shop requires customers to register and login before buying, because some twisted minds out there think that having a password is absolutely essential to communicate with customers (I have 82 passwords last time I checked). Those same twisted minds also have the guts to ask you everything from your shoe size to your dog's name, and make those fields &lt;em>required&lt;/em> in the registration proces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now suppose that shop sells &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtainium">Unobtanium&lt;/a>, and you really need that for your project. You see that it's in stock, so you enter the registration process to be able to fill your shooping cart. You fill in your dog's name, press &amp;quot;register&amp;quot; and your data is sent to the server... unencrypted! The hacker monitoring the site's traffic sees your personal information and uses it to steal your dog, selling it online through e-Bay the next day with relative ease.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I typed and removed a whole rant about shops asking you way too much information because sick marketing minds think they are god and can ask and use your information as they please. But some shops need information to ship the products to you. Aside from offering you Unobtanium for a very attractive price, they also need to earn your trust for you to enter your personal data. Funny thing is that nobody seems to care if that site is passing information around using plain http.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have had email discussions with 3 companies so far who asked me to register online over http connections. When a company sends my personal. private information or password over http, I send them a mail I can not comply because of the simple fact that the password is rendered useless by sending it in plain text over the network. Most companies don't see the problem and think they are doing everything perfectly safe (those are the scariest). Then there are the companies who know it is in fact not safe, but simply state that they don't care, or don't want to pay for an &amp;quot;expensive&amp;quot; secure solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think in most cases, &lt;a href="http://www.kelkoo.co.uk/">these&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.buyonline.nl/">buttugly&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://www.absoluteword.com/order/">shops&lt;/a> (of which the last can't even display it's own Russian characterset) are developed by you, my dear World-of-Warcraft playing, family kid-genius friend. The world is in the hands of &lt;a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zitface">zitfaced&lt;/a> 13 year old &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">noobs&lt;/a>&amp;quot; to life who think downloading software without paying for it is cool, and have the nerve to tell shopkeepers that their PHP-MySQL-Tomcat solution on an old 386 machine running the obscurest version of default-installed Linux without firewalls over http is perfectly safe to store customer data and VISA card numbers. These kids are probably the very same kids who think that &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gk/atwork/">under construction&lt;/a>&amp;quot; is a very normal term to use on your site because they are, in fact, developing software on the live production server and their tiny mind can't think of any other way to hide those parts from the customer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay, I lost myself there, but you get the point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I really don't get, is that with the computing power nowadays, protocols like http still even exist. Why isn't each and every server doing https by default? Even my 3-year old mobile phone can do https, so let's fase out http alltogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the site administrator is anything like the one at my office, chances are that a lot of sites will have random, or self-signed certificates which are expired 2 days after they're made, never to be replaced with new ones. To circumvent this, we should have a public-certificate server like a &lt;a href="http://keyserver.pgp.com/">PGP key server&lt;/a>. When I access a site with an unknown certificate to me, I can check that certificate at some centralized server, where I can find if this certificate is really belonging to that site (yeah yeah I know about certificate chains, but admin's don't). Besides that, the site could also list if the shops is handling it's data carefully, if your email address is sold, or used to spam you. This data can be statistical, and/or based on customer reviews.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next step is that in stead of your browser showing you a tiny, small lock icon at the bottom of your screen indicating this is &amp;quot;safe&amp;quot; https, the browser should display a big fat red cross accross the whole site indicating that it's &lt;em>not&lt;/em> https.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trouble this will cause, is that site admins will still not protect their data, but hey, I guess there's only so much you can do. Maybe we need a global police department running site-scans to detect unsafe sites, and list them on the public certificate-server we discussed for everybody to see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next step would be to make it illegal to store data that's not yours in an unsafe manner. Yes internet is &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; and I think we should try to keep it that way in the original sense of the word in the early internet years. Right now, the word &amp;quot;free&amp;quot; on the internet is used to defend the rights of (internet)criminals. But that's a different story...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, make sure your data, any data about you, is transported over https. Spam companies who are still using http or otherwise unsafe methods to transport your data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wordpress.com is a good example...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Backup Guru?

&lt;p>Today I listened to a podcast called &lt;a href="http://formaceyesonly.blogspot.com/">&amp;quot;For Mac Eyes Only&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, in which people were complaining about how &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_%28Apple_software%29">Time Machine&lt;/a> does not work &amp;quot;the way they want it to&amp;quot;. I think this is utter crap, and I will explain why.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->To start off, I think I am safe to say that 99% of the people complaining about Time Machine's behaviour did not do backups of any kind at all, until Time Machine came along and "ruined their backup scheme".
&lt;p>Because of my work as a software engineer, people tend to consult me with their PC/Mac problems. More than once, these problems concern lost files, and no backup whatsoever. I think that in the past 10 years of my life, I have only spoken to 2 people who had an actual working automated backup schedule/scheme. Maybe 3 people made occasional backups to CD, of which 1 painfully discovered that CD's don't last forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The copy-cat complainers about Time Machine, are easily put off by the question &amp;quot;What did you backups with before today?&amp;quot;. Usually this question results in stuttering and a lot of &amp;quot;uhhhmm&amp;quot;s and then some vague excuse about forgetting to buy CD's and what a hassle manual backups are. These people need to loose more data to understand the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, there are the &amp;quot;techies&amp;quot; who claim that Time Machine is technically inferior, lacks intricate timing and retentioning schemes, and that it's not an &amp;quot;off site&amp;quot; backup. I'll try to answer some of those questions because I think Time Machine is absolutely the best thing that has hapenned to the computing industry in decades since the introduction of OSX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine can not be scheduled&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Totally true. And that's exactly a good thing. The Time Machine scheduling is one backup every hour. This is way better than any of the companies I have ever worked at, and way better than any of the client companies I worked for. Servers are usually backed up once a day. With Time Machine, you will not loose more than 1 hour of work, which is amazing by industry standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Designing your own backup schedule to &amp;quot;not interfere with your working hours&amp;quot; will make it more likely that your backup will not run at all, or will run immediately when you turn on the computer because it missed a slot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine does not do block-level backups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many commercial backup programs can do block-level backups. This means that they are backing up only those parts of your files that are modified. Because these blocks need to be reconstructed into files when restoring them, you'll need the proprietary software to make a restore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Time Machine, a changed file gets backed up entirely. Although this will cost a bit more room on the backup disk, it gives you the option to take the backup disk to another computer, mount it and search for files in your backup tree. A &amp;quot;restore&amp;quot; is nothing more than a drag-and-drop of the file to any computer you like. Not depending on Time Machine, you can restore files from your Leopard machine to any machine capable of reading your USB drive!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine will not create bootable backups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that's a good thing too. People tend to be lazy. Suppose Time Machine made a bootable image of your harddrive. This would mean that as soon as you crash your drive, you can boot into your backup drive and carry on with your work. By doing that, you no longer have a backup process in place for the new work you are doing. Because a system restore is a drag, you'll continue to work from the backup drive, up until the point that you crash that one too, and realize that you have no backup of your backup drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A complete system restore from a Time Machine backup is as simple as putting in the Leopard DVD, boot, and tell the installer to do a restore. It will install a fresh OS, and then restore all of your files, up until the point that you can no longer tell that you did a new install. From your mail, to your bookmarks, to even the locations of the icons of your desktop will be the same as you left it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The need for a bootable backup is very rare. Most of the time you'll use Time Machine to restore that one file, mail or photo you accidentally deleted. That's what it does the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine backups aren't &amp;quot;off-site&amp;quot; backups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, Time Machine does not place your backups on a disk somewhere in India. If you'd like to do that, I'd recommend writing an rsync script and sync to a remotely mounted DMG file over a secure network connection. Time Machine is not meant for saving you when your house burns down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That having said, it is expected that Apple will re-implement the backup-to-network-drive feature of Time Machine, and by doing that, your backup can be anywhere on your network, and that enables you to do interesting things...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I can't explain backups to my aunt Bessie&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.thumbnail.png" alt="Time Machine Settings">
&lt;/a>Now that is just plain nonsense. There is almost no user interface to Time Machine. Making Time Machine work actually requires nothing more than plugging in a drive, and clicking &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; in the dialog window that pops up, asking you if you'd like to use this drive as a backup drive. For the non-believers, you can see the Time Machine settings pane at the right. Yes, that's right, it has an on-off switch. Complex, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not being a computer wizzard, your aunt Bessie has probably lost or misplaced a file more than once, maybe even up to the point that she's actualy afraid to use the computer because &amp;quot;it looses her files&amp;quot;. Besides learning her to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">spotlight&lt;/a>, you can show how Time Machine can easily be used to restore that file for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In stead of complaining about the bits that actually make Time Machine a good backup system in the first place, get people to do backups! Even if it isn't by using Time Machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, one last time:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shut-up-and-back-up-">**Shut up and back up! **&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>(And for professionals in the fiels there is an additional excercise: &lt;strong>Do a restore test every now and then!&lt;/strong> You'll be surprised at how much data you can not recover from your intricate full/incremental tape-cycling high-tech backup plan.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Helicopter fun</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/12/06/helicopter-fun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2007 22:08:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/12/06/helicopter-fun/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>A couple of friends of mine bought me a great toy for my birthday: my very own personal Helicopter! It is an amazing piece of engineering, weighing only a couple of grams, and having a very simple remote with the usual &amp;quot;left/right/forward/reverse&amp;quot; type of remote.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->After a bit of practice, it is actually pretty easy to fly. Once you get it to stop wiggling in the air (patience!), it will start flying forward at a slow pace, at which point you can steer it left or right. While turning, it will loose or pick up speed depending if you make a left or right turn. The least bit of draft in the house will "feel" like a storm, so keep the windos closed.
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/2712717">my photo's&lt;/a> of it taking off from my coffee table and flying into the kitchen.

&lt;p>Should you be in the position that you are convicted to spending 3 or 4 hours in the Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.alcatraz.nl/politie.html">Alcatraz theatre program&lt;/a>, there are a few things you should know beforehand. The photographs on the site have absolutely nothing to do with the show itself, and should not be used to judge setting or quality. The audience is not only encouraged, but in fact required to play an active part in the &amp;quot;show&amp;quot;. The whole show is based on humiliation of people in front of their friends/collegues. The show is definetely not wheelchair friendly, and toilets are in fact unreachable by wheelchair.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->This is what will happen:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * From the moment you enter the building to the moment you leave, you and your party will be shouted at, insulted, and treated as infants. There will even be some public physical humiliation too for a few chosen ones.
* Depending on the arrangement, you can be called by name to step forward, and are then subject to cheap jokes based on information given to the cast prior to your arrival.
* There is no real break. The show lasts 3 to 4 hours, and during that time there are a few brief moments you can drink or eat in a tiny space cramped with 20 people in a cell, sitting on wooden benches.
* Entertainment will be limited to a few sing-and-dance moments, of which at least 2 will contain singing &amp;quot;Je ne regrette rien&amp;quot;.
* Performances will range from moderate quality to cheap to plain vulgar, generally the stuff you'd expect at cheap backalley theatres.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>These are pointers to survive:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Do not enter the building in the first place, unless you are socially forced or tricked.
* Eat before you enter. Although food is advertized to be served, it is of avarage microwave-meal quality, and there is a big chance you are not allowed to eat all of it.
* Drink before you enter. Getting a drink means you have to communicate with one of the cast. This can result in more humiliating shouting, no matter how polite you ask.
* Mingle and dissapear in the crowd. Try not to be at the edges of a group. The concrete pillars will block a lot of the view of the cast, make use of them to stay out of sight, but be casual about it.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Picking a good moment and route to leave:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. After entering the building, it will be some time before you can leave without alarming anyone. Wait for the right moment.
2. There will be a &amp;quot;trail&amp;quot; where the &amp;quot;judge&amp;quot; will read cheap and uncomfortably personal jokes about you and your party from a piece of paper. Moving our coughing will place you in the center of attention. Hold still.
3. You are sent to walk down an isle while hearing a long, slow and boring story about a made-up Alcatraz inmate and his wife. The cast is around you in uniform, still no chance to leave without a trace.
4. The lights will go out while everbody is standing close to eachother, and a lot of noise will be made with the prison bars around you. Claustrofobic people will definetely not like this. The door behind you is black, closed and barely visible, still no good time to leave.
5. Lights will go on and you are ordered to enter the cells, about 10 to 20 people per cell. The cells have no doors that can be closed. There will be some shouting, ordering you to stand up if you're sitting, and sit down when you're standing. The guards have a strange fascination of ordering people to put their hands in the air.
6. At some point, you will be given soup and bread. Don't bother with it, it will be taken from you as soon as everybody starts to eat.
7. [![Alcatraz escape plan](alcatraz-escape.thumbnail.jpg)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](alcatraz-escape.jpg)As soon as you see a green bus entering the building, that's your queue. It signals a &amp;quot;break&amp;quot; in the program where preople can get drinks.
8. Walk to the bar where wine and soda is served (marked drinks/food in &lt;a href="alcatraz-escape.jpg">the map&lt;/a>).
9. When at the bar, kindly ask where the toilets are. You will be directed (ordered) through a black door, and you'll find yourself in the room where the trail was held, and the toilets and wardrobe are. The white doors can be opened from the inside, try the small door next to the wardrobe first. (Follow the red line in the map).
10. Walk to your car and hope noone misses you before you can start it. After that, enjoy your freedom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote this plan because I regret leaving earlier. I kept thinking this nonsense could not last 3 hours, but it did. There are people who like this kind of entertainment very much, but I don't. The problem is that if your party has a good time, the social pressure of joining the fun can be tremendous, and can lead you into doing stuff you'll regret later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would strongly advise against going to this show.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Scholierenstaking (Dutch)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/27/scholierenstaking-dutch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2007 20:52:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/27/scholierenstaking-dutch/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Tijd om auto's in brand te steken van onschuldige mensen die daar jaren voor gespaard hebben want ojee, de scholieren krijgen 1040 lesuren. En dat terwijl ze 960 uur al genoeg les vinden met al dat huiswerk dat ze krijgen. Het is zelfs zo erg dat het komt tot &lt;a href="http://www.rtl.nl//actueel/rtlnieuws/binnenland/articleview//components/actueel/rtlnieuws/2007/11_november/19/binnenland/1119_1519_arrestaties_scholieren_sittard.xml">Aanhoudingen bij scholierenstaking&lt;/a>. Misschien is het tijd om het op een akkoordje te gooien.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Nou kan ik heel makkelijk shermen met statements als _"wees blij dat je les krijgt"_ en _"de kindjes in Afrika..."_ maar dat komt natuurlijk allemaal niet aan en bovendien wordt ik daar zelf ook misselijk van. Om een beetje een beeld te krijgen waarom die 1040 uur nou zo'n probleem is, heb ik even een simpel rekensommetje bedacht. (Nee, dit mag je niet van je studieuren aftrekken).
&lt;p>Straks, in de grote boze wereld werk je 40 uur per week. 40x52 weken = 2080 uur per jaar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Natuurlijk werk je niet iedere week de hele week. Je krijgt meestal tussen de 25 en 30 vrije dagen per jaar. Laten we rekenen met 30 vrije dagen, dat is 30x8 uur = 240 vrije uren per jaar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Daarnaast zijn er natuurlijk feestdagen die niet in het weekend vallen, laten we even zeggen dat we daar een stuk of 10 van hebben (lijkt me aan de ruime kant). 10x8 = 80 uur vrij i.v.m. feestdagen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hoeveel uren werkt een gemiddelde werknemer met een voltijd baan dus ongeveer per jaar?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2080 - 240 - 80 = &lt;strong>1760 uur per jaar&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In vergelijking met een gemiddelde werknemer heb je na de 1040 lesuren dus nog 720 uur over om je huiswerk te maken. Dus stel, je ergste droom wordt werkelijkheid en je krijgt bij alle vakken huiswerk mee. Je kunt dan voor ieder uur dat je op school zit ruim 41 minuten huiswerk maken, en dan ben je nog steeds klaar voordat pa en/of ma thuiskomt van zijn/haar werk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Het lijkt er bijna op dat het aantal uren op school bijna niet meer is dan een goede smoes om wat herrie te trappen. Maar door het lage aantal schooldagen door alle vakanties kan de lengte van de schooldag natuurlijk wel oplopen. Omdat scholieren meer vrije dagen hebben moeten ze de lesuren dus in minder werkdagen verstoken, en dan zou het wel eens op een complete werkdag kunnen gaan lijken, waarna je je huiswerk nog moet doen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ik ben geen scholier meer, dus ik kan er niet zomaar een oordeel over vellen. Er is een stemmetje dat zegt dat de meeste ouders misschien wel 3000 lesuren per jaar zouden willen invoeren. Waarom? Dat wat eerst nog &amp;quot;een leuk babietje&amp;quot; leek, blijkt minstens 21 jaar lang 24x7 support nodig te hebben, en een hoop geld te kosten. Zoonlief kan tenslotte ook niet met een tweedehands iPod op school komen, wat moeten de andere ouders daar niet van denken?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Omdat Pa en Ma kaalgeplukt worden door een regering die niet met centjes kan omgaan, en toch ook wel gehecht zijn aan de BMW X5 en de grote eensgezinswoning (lees: zelf ook niet met centjes om kunnen gaan) moeten ze alletwee blijven werken. En tsja, dan is het lastig dat je kind vroeg van school komt, als je zelf niet thuis bent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vroeger was naschoolse opvang meer een soort service voor incidentele gevallen waarbij zoonlief even niet thuis terecht kon. Het groeit nu uit naar een &amp;quot;standaardpakket&amp;quot; waartoe scholen verplicht worden. Naschoolse opvang is gegroeid tot een &amp;quot;collectieve kind dump service&amp;quot; voor mensen die niet nagedacht hebben over het opvoeden van een kind. Sommige mensen herinneren zich de reclame &lt;em>&amp;quot;wie is toch die man die zondag het vlees komt snijden&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. Dit is voor veel gezinnen tegenwoordig gruwelijke werkelijkheid geworden, zelfs zo erg dat het &lt;em>&amp;quot;wie zijn toch die mensen die me ieder weekend naar de IKEA brengen en denken dat ik dat leuk vind?&amp;quot;&lt;/em> gaat worden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misschien moeten we dus voor een compromis gaan: Nou vooruit, 1000 lesuren per schooljaar, op voorwaarde dat er ten alle tijde Ã©Ã©n van beide ouders thuis is om de kinderen op te vangen. Daarmee wordt de kostbare naschoolse opvang overbodig en hebben leraren wat meer lucht. Het lost gelijk nog een probleem op: Kinderen hoeven elkaar niet meer op te voeden. Ouders zijn gewoon thuis en kunnen de kinderen corrigeren (tsja sorry, dat hoort erbij) en normen bijbrengen (alweer sorry). Zoals bijvoorbeeld de norm dat je niet andermans spullen sloopt als je het zelf ergens niet mee eens bent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zullen we met zijn allen eens normaal gaan doen?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What If Gmail Had Been Designed by Microsoft?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/22/what-if-gmail-had-been-designed-by-microsoft/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Nov 2007 20:53:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/22/what-if-gmail-had-been-designed-by-microsoft/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Since the comming of rss feeds, the world is a better place for online people like me. I can select interesting newsfeeds I'd like to read, and compose my own newspaper. For newssites, this requires a new skill. For them to keep me as a reader, they need to keep the rss feed up to date, and with items I'd like to see. Because I can do research on the spot, the news items better be balanced, verified and unbiased (unless it's funny ;-). Recently I dumped the &lt;a href="http://www.nu.nl/">nu.nl&lt;/a> rss feed because of the constant re-posting of only slightly modified articles.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->At this time, I am monitoring about 30 newsfeeds, which are mostly centered around programming and technology. I don't care much for journalism in general, because I think nowadays it's biased, often unverified, and very much geared to "get the most viewers". This results in over-the-top dramatic and emotional articles, generally only covering death, hunger, war and preferably contains "shocking images". Good news just doesn't sell.
&lt;p>Up until now, I only had 1 rss feed covering local daily news, which was the nu.nl feed. A few weeks ago, I noticed that nu.nl had become more active. The rss feed kept popping up as having new items, but when I checked them, they looked familiar. At the time I thought it was a date-bug in either the reader or at the feedserver. Today, I checked more thourougly and found out that this is probably deliberate. 33% of the items in the nu.nl rss feed are re-posts or only slightly modified articles. Very irritating, and almost makes you think that the nu.nl journalists are freelancers which are payed per article. It gave me the feeling of a little kid who is telling you over-and-over again that it found a penny.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="nu-rss-done-right.png">&lt;img src="nu-rss-done-right.png" alt="nu rss feed doneÂ right">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I took a screenshot of the nu.nl feed in the &lt;a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader&lt;/a>, and highlighted the double entries. Then I removed the articles which could have been prevented from showing up in the rss feed. The result is shown at the right. From the 33 articles in the original feed, only 22 contained new information. That means that 33% of the feed-alerts for the nu.nl feed makes me waste time to look at news I've allready seen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If somebody tells me that people are dying somewere, it ruins my day. I can't stand people hurting eachother. Since journalists are having the tendency to report people dying every 6 seconds (because it sells), and nu.nl also finds it necesary to make sure I read it by re-posting 33% of their content, I've dropped the feed. And actually it feels nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've already almost stopped watching TV, because of the repetiteveness, and constant display of dead, dismembered people 24x7, regardless of viewer age or interest. Now, I've unsubscribed the last &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; newsfeed and I think my world will get brighter because of it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe someday the word &amp;quot;reality&amp;quot; is no longer related to 5000 top-payed reporters pointing their camera's at a dying child without helping it. And I hope that that same day, the word &amp;quot;reality-TV&amp;quot; is no longer related to locking people inside a house, pointing camera's at them while they fight eachother for a moneyprice. And maybe, just maybe, the word &amp;quot;news&amp;quot; could also include the &lt;a href="http://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/">good news&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="http://www.explodingcigar.com/article2042.html">wierd news&lt;/a>, and every other kind of news to balance things out. And if that day is &lt;a href="http://www.yarr.org.uk/">19 September&lt;/a>, we'd be in for a lot of fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSX 10.5.1 Update, still SMB problems</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/16/osx-1051-update-still-smb-problems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Nov 2007 22:03:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/16/osx-1051-update-still-smb-problems/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Last week, I hapily installed OSX 10.5 (Leopard) on my trusty Mac Mini. The upgrade from Tiger went without a hitch, and the system even got a bit &amp;quot;snappier&amp;quot;. For a week, I had no major issues with Leopard. The Dock dissapeared once, and I had a non-reacting keyboard once when waking from sleep mode. Other than that I am a happy Leopard user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up until a few das ago, when I tried to access my newly acquired 500GB &lt;a href="http://www.iomega.com/direct/products/detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=51400371&amp;amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=31699021&amp;amp;ASSORTMENT%3C%3East_id=26890319&amp;amp;bmUID=1195162566206">Iomega Network Storage&lt;/a>. The Iomega drive is a network connected drive, formatted as FAT32, and accessible through the samba (SMB://) protocol. With Leopard, I could see the drive in the network, and I could double click on it's shares, but when (if) the share connected, I could not drag files onto it, or see what is on the disk. Unmounting takes ages, and sometimes requires me to &amp;quot;killall -9 Finder&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I browsed the net and found quite a few people on forums discussing the same problem. Luckaly, Apple also had payed attention, and put out an update, which I installed just a few minutes ago. Sad thing is, that this update does not solve my problem (yes, that's Dutch you're reading):
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-3.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.png" alt="Upload to Samba Share problem">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I tried all tips I could find in the forums:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Connect using the IP address, rather than the network name
* Change the group of the device (WORKGROUP changed to NOTIT)
* Remove any non-alphabetical characters from paswords
* Remove passwords alltogether
* Connect using CIFS:// in stead of SMB://
* Any combination of the above
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After previous experience with Apple products I seriously began doubting the samba implementation of the Iomega drive. So I tried some things on the Iomega drive, amongst which were:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * installing a (wrong) firmware update, which almost bricked it.
* Resetting to factory defaults
* Erasing Mac sidecar or meta files (the .DS ones)
* Formatting the drive completely
* Unsetting and setting passwords
* Changing share names to lowercase
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>But still, nothing. Leopard will not properly access this drive. Funny thing is, that when I try to connect to the Iomega drive from my other Mac, which runs Tiger, it works flawlessly. And I can also connect to that same drive from a Windows machine. This makes it clearly a Leopard problem to me, and one that still needs to be fixed, despite the speedy update issued by Apple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can we have another fix please, Apple? I can't reach my remote rsynced backups until you do...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Block Luntbuild 1.5.1 Anonymous Access</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/13/block-luntbuild-151-anonymous-access/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Nov 2007 13:52:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/13/block-luntbuild-151-anonymous-access/</guid><description>
&lt;p>If you are using &lt;a href="http://luntbuild.javaforge.com/">luntbuild &lt;/a>for your continuous integration builds at work, you probably want to remove anonymous user access.

&lt;p>In the same file, searchfor the &lt;em>filterChainProxy&lt;/em> bean and remove references to the &lt;em>anonymousProcessingFilter&lt;/em> bean, and save the file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Double check that when you do a &lt;em>cat applicationContext.xml | grep anonymousProcessingFilter&lt;/em>, nothing is returned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now restart the luntbuild application. Please note that if you were logged in as anonymous before you rebooted the server, your session will still work. This is because you passed the security gates earlier, and Tomcat remembers your session. Press &amp;quot;Forget&amp;quot; and try to login as anonymous. This should no longer work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really hope that in luntbuild 2.0, anonymous access is removed or at least configurable from the administation pages, and that the &amp;quot;Forget&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Logout&amp;quot; links are merged into one, because they seem to do the same thing to the user.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clonezilla: m4d Sk!lZ</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/06/clonezilla-m4d-sklz/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Nov 2007 00:09:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/06/clonezilla-m4d-sklz/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago, my Dad and my Brother both bought identical Windows Vista machines, at the same shop, at the same time. Although the hardware specs of these computers were terrific, the performance of Windows Vista was &amp;quot;moderate&amp;quot; to say the least. An even bigger problem was that some of the older XP programs my dad had been using did no longer work on the shiny new Vista machine. The shiny 3D effects had to go in favour of something that &amp;quot;just worked&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Having just spent a lot of cash on these now paperweights, a new Apple was not an option (hey, I tried). So my dad bought a Windows XP install CD and started installing on his machine. The shiny new hardware was so new, that the XP divers were hard to find, if they existed at all. After 2 weeks of fiddling with drivers, the machine was "up and limping". The display was at a nice resolution, and it could produce a sort of audio, and the prio 1 software packages were installed and working (mainly some simple calendar and assembly-development tools).
&lt;p>My brother also was fed up with Vista, and asked if we could mirror the harddisk in my dad's machine to his machine. I figured that this should be no problem, since the machines were exactly identical. Because of earlier problems with Norton Ghost and SATA drives, I decided to give Clonezilla a try.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that I am NOT linking to the Clonezilla site in this article, which is for your own good. Why? I will tell you why! For people who are so smart that they can read partition tables before morning coffee, understand 32 different partition types, and can do on-the-fly custom compression of a datastream to an USB disk, they shure have never heard of &amp;quot;user experience&amp;quot;. There is absolutely no way that normal people are ever getting this thing to work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>...You may take a pause here to reflect on that if you like...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When booting the Clonezilla CD, it shows you what it's doing my scrolling text accross your screen at a speed at which you need bionical implants to be able to follow. I did manage to catch a few lines, and I must not be smart enough because I don't know what &amp;quot;Loading NVIDIA Video Driver&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Setting System Clock&amp;quot; have to do with reading bits from a disk and writing them to another disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="1.png">&lt;img src="1.thumbnail.png" alt="Clonezilla splash screen">
&lt;/a>After the frantic scrolling is done, you are presented with an ever so nice menu screen, designed by a colorblind handicapped rhinoceros with a Sinus problem. The first time I looked at this sceen I waited for a menu option to get highlighted, and before I realized that the light pink bar was the highlighted menu item, it started booting by itself. Yes, if you do nothing, it does &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; but since you're not sure what, you have to reboot and start over again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other fun part of this menu screen is that it gives you no less than 8 options to boot your system, 4 of which are Clonezilla. There's even an option which contains the word &amp;quot;framebuffer&amp;quot;, which is a video card thing and again has absolutely no other purpose than to confuse you. Framebuffers have nothing to do with (re)storing disk partitions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="2.png">&lt;img src="2.thumbnail.png" alt="Clonezilla language options">
&lt;/a>After having made the right choice (I took a wild guess) you are presented with another nice screen. The design of this screen is from a whole different erra, almost van-Gogh-esque. All the video drivers which were loaded during the &amp;quot;frantic scrolling&amp;quot; fase earlier are clearly working together on this screen to present you the nicest resolution and the clearest colors, so that you can peruse the long list of language options available to perfectly support you during the following screens. At the bottom of the menu are two aptly named &lt;ok> and &lt;cancel> buttons, start over if you didn't use the correct one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="3.png">&lt;img src="3.thumbnail.png" alt="Keymap menu">
&lt;/a>Now that the Clonezilla is running in the language of your choice (which is very likely not to be traditional Chinese), you'd expect to enter the realm of disk options. Not so. Take out your &amp;quot;Linux Unleashed&amp;quot; books class, because we're presented with... nobody? no? The keymap option! Yes, that's right. No program can start without asking what keymap it should use. Turn to page 346 of the &amp;quot;Advanced&amp;quot; section to find out what keymap the &amp;quot;Kernel keymap&amp;quot; is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After reading the instructions 3 times you learn that you can just hit &amp;quot;enter&amp;quot; on this screen, just like you did on the silly language options menu.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="4.png">&lt;img src="4.thumbnail.png" alt="Start Clonezilla?">
&lt;/a>Off to cloning, right? Wrong. Clonezilla will ask you if you'd want to start Clonezilla, or just enter the prompt. Exactly the one credible extra option on the first &amp;quot;designer&amp;quot; screen is presented after 3 menus. And no, we don't want a prompt, so it's not a good option here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'll spare you the rest of the menus. There are just way too much, containing anything ranging from spelling and grammar errors, to cryptic messages and listing command line options to tools you've never heard of.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Okay one more small example: In stead of using the screen real-estate and the nice fonts to indicate what disks are in the system and what partitions are on there, it just lists &amp;quot;sda1, sda2, sda5, sde1&amp;quot; and their formats. When you are a windows user, and are backing up or restoring your precious data, you are likely to stop here. How do you know for sure that you're reading from and writing to the right disk?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If Clonezilla was made for people, I would have expected a list according to these lines:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Harddisk 1 (320GB Seagate, SATA)
Partition 1 (120GB, FAT32, Volume label &amp;quot;My Windows&amp;quot;)
Partition 2 (100GB, NTFS, Volume label &amp;quot;My Data&amp;quot;)
Partition 3 (100GB, NTFS, Volume label &amp;quot;My Music&amp;quot;)
Harddisk 2 (500GB Iomega, USB)
Partition 1 (500GB, FAT32, Volume label &amp;quot;Backupdisk&amp;quot;)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Anyway, struggling through the menu's, reading through command line options and Googling for manual pages on the used commands I eventually got Clonezilla to make a backup of the entire disk of my Dad's XP installation. The disk image was stored on a large harddrive, and we took it to my brother's machine to restore it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before restoring the XP disk image, we made another disk image, from the original Vista installation on my brothers machine. Should something happen, we would have an option to restore the machine to it's prestine state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We restored the XP image on my brothers Vista machine (which was, like I said, an exactly identical machine). And you guessed it: it failed. We tried playing with the MBR and Grub options, and every try we neede to wait the full 20 minutes only to find out that the restore did not work. We even tried restoring the partition tables and/or MBR's using the Windows XP installation disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After 6 frustrating hours on Saturday, and another 3 gruelling hours today, we gave up. Clonezilla is now restoring Vista to my brother's computer, and I sure hope that will work, but wether it does or doesn't, it leaves him with a useless computer. Either way we're destined to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leet">&amp;quot;m4d sk!lz&amp;quot;&lt;/a> to get it running normally again, just like we need &amp;quot;m4d sk!lz&amp;quot; to be able to use Clonezilla.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Sidenote to Linux developers: Just because you know a lot about Linux or any freaking back-from-the-60's command line tool there is out there, doesn't mean you can expect others to have that same knowledge. As long as Linux fanboys are creating these crappy user interfaces, Linux is not going to stand up against Microsoft or Apple on the desktop. Ever. And creating &amp;quot;Yet Another Window Manager&amp;quot; will also not help. Period. Together you stand, &lt;a href="http://apcmag.com/6735/interview_con_kolivas">devided you'll fall&lt;/a>. So far, devision by childish stubborn ego flamewars is where every non-commercial Linux project has ended.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next option for my brother and dad is to buy Norton Ghost 12, and hope that the people at Norton understand how to make a user interface, and working software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the arrival of Vista, Windows more and more turning into a Tamagochi, where you are spending more time maintaining the system, than working &lt;em>with&lt;/em> the system. I'm glad I dumped Windows a long time ago. For those who are thinking of switching: I can promise you that Switching from XP to Vista will give you &lt;a href="http://apcmag.com/6649/vista_150_problems_0_solutions">more problems&lt;/a> than &lt;a href="http://www.utilware.com/switching.html">switching from XP to Mac&lt;/a>. And once you go Mac...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tips for European Apple customers</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/03/tips-for-european-apple-customers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2007 22:06:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/03/tips-for-european-apple-customers/</guid><description>
&lt;p>For me as a european consumer, the low Dollar (or: high Euro) is a good thing. Particularly when travelling to the U.S., or buying American consumer electronics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Apple, as a big company with complete control over it's retail prices, the low Dollar (or: high Euro) is a good thing. Particularly when the conversion rates sneak up on the consumers and you &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; to adjust your 1-to-1 Euro-to-Dollar conversion in your stores. Time to wake up the European Apple consumers.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->So how good is the Euro to Dollar converison rate for Apple? At the time of writing, â¬1.00 equals $1.4443. Comparing actual product prices between the online [U.S. Apple store](http://store.apple.com/) and the [Dutch Apple store](http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/nlstore.woa/), we can see how Apple's margin has increased with the exact 1.4443 conversion rate, baring the MacBook:

This is nice for Apple, but how can we make this nice for us consumers? Apple certainly is not going to lower it's prices in Europe, because Steve is in it for the money (prove me wrong soon, will you, Steve)? As far as I see, the European Apple consumer has 4 options:
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 1:&lt;/strong> Just buy the stuff you want, pay the Euro price and be happy with the value for money. Added bonus: you helped &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve&lt;/a> invest in future products, and maybe he'll &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/2992">give away another mansion&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 2:&lt;/strong> Wait for the â¬ to drop. This is a nice option if you were planning on an Apple free diet anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 3:&lt;/strong> Order the product you want in the U.S., and see if they'll send it to Europe. Maybe you'll have to have your product sent to a friend living in the U.S., and have him send it to you. Sometimes a hotel in which you stayed recently can be tricked into receiving and forwarding your package, as long as it's not to big. They'll charge your creditcard, so be carefull.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 4:&lt;/strong> Say you'd want the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">Mac Pro double core duo&lt;/a> (the cheapest Mac Pro model). Say you would like to buy that in the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/lincolnroad/week/20071028.html">Miami Apple Store&lt;/a> at Lincoln road. You could buy 2 oneway tickets at &lt;a href="http://www.exit-reizen.nl/reizen/vliegtickets/vliegtickets.html">exit-reizen&lt;/a>, which would set you back about â¬820.00 ($567.75). Because it's a long flight and you'd like to do some sight-seeing, you book 2 nights at the beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.secure-res.com/res/vn3/hchgs.aspx?hotelid=1599&amp;amp;roomid=6754&amp;amp;checkindate=11/10/2007&amp;amp;nights=2&amp;amp;rooms=1&amp;amp;trr=CFFFFFDA6F9EA1&amp;amp;adults=1&amp;amp;children=0&amp;amp;culture=1&amp;amp;culturename=nl-NL&amp;amp;site=SEO&amp;amp;wtpid=dcs5l6fkf00000omppulmk93o_3n3q">Clay hotel&lt;/a> at South Beach Miami at &amp;quot;Budget&amp;quot; rate, which totals to $172,89 including tax. During the trip, you spend about, say, $350.00 on cab fares, tips, food and souvenirs for the family. When you return home, you will have spent $1090.64 for the tip, including the purchase of your Mac Pro. At the current European price, &lt;em>you still have saved $19.66!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For iPods and other gadgets, I'd say option 1 and 3 are the best options, because I know you can't wait once you are an Apple addict. If you're planning on buying anything more expensive than an iMac, I would seriously consider option 4. You can get away with flying from Europe to Miami and back, picking it up yourself and still spending the same amount of money as you would have spent just picking it up in Amsterdam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How's that for Currency Market?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Headphone search</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/01/headphone-search/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2007 22:09:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/11/01/headphone-search/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Last week I've been complaining about the capped volume on the iPod nano and the inability to circumvent it. At the end of that very week, the iPod earbuds solved the problem for me by breaking down. The rubber rings started comming off, and the right speaker produced only 10% of the sound the left speaker was producing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided that this was enough reason to go looking for a nice set of in-ear headphones (earbuds) which would sound nice, and also improve on produced volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8110.jpg">&lt;!-- more -->&lt;img src="img_8110.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Apple ear-buds">
&lt;/a>After reading some reviews on in-ear headphones ranging from â¬40,- to â¬140,- I decided on the Apple in-ear headphones. Judging from reviews, these should compare to Sony Fontopia's, seal of surrounding noise and produce more sound. I payed the â¬40,- (that's $58,- at the current Dollar-to-Euro rate) and plugged them into the ipod, and my ears. Although I have pretty standard ears,Â  I couldn't get the Apple earbuds to fit comfortably. Apple provides 3 different size caps, of which the middle size was the least uncomfortable, and sealed off my ear properly. You can tell this by the pressure you feel in your ear when inserting the buds. The pressure will slowly go away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I noticed is that by sealing off your earcanal, you can hear everything going on with the cords to the earbuds. Move your head, and you hear the cord move accross your clothes at a pretty uncomfortable volume. When playing music, don't move. The cord movement sounds will sometimes be louder than the music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sitting perfectly still and trying to judge the sound quality, I found that the Apple ear-buds are actually not good at all. Yes they provide lots of bass (which is a measure of quality nowadays I guess) but everything else is lacking. They sound flat, and miss the sharpness I expect from expensive earbuds. They are absolutely sounding worse than the standard earbuds that came with the iPod. If I had too choose between the two, I'd go for the standard iPod earphones in stead of the more expensive ear-buds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with headphones in general and in-ear headphones in particular, is that you can't return them, because they can't be sold as new after you've jammed them in your ears. For that same reason I'm probably not going to sell them second hand, making these buds one of the more expensive pieces of trash in my bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8111.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8111.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Sony earphones">
&lt;/a> Last weekend I passed through a hardware store to buy a new harddrive for my fileserver. Next to the cash register I found a pair of &lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/headphones-headsets/sony-mdr-e818lp/4505-6468_7-6900020.html">Sony MDR-E818LP&lt;/a> earphones for about â¬10,-. I bought them so that I could at least listen to music until I found a set of decent earphones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And guess what? These sound great! They've got too much bass (probably a fashion thing), but that can be cured with the &amp;quot;less bass&amp;quot; setting on the iPod. By doing that, these earphones are the right thing for your iPod, at the right price. The sound is clear and crisp, and these buds produce a LOT more sound than the Apple ones. They don't seal off your ear, which I've come to beleive is a good thing, because of the cord-sound I described above. They come with a set of soft cushions which make for a comfortable fit, and I can wear them for hours at an end without getting sore ears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get some of the â¬40,- spent on the Apple ear-buds back, I am using the Apple ear-bud carying case to store the Sony earphones in. The Sony's are worth it. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse this isn't the best set of earphones I've ever had. The old Sony fontopids that came with the first walkmans were absolutely the best in-ear headphones I've ever had. Comfortable fit, supple silicone cords, with red and blue stripes on the earpieces to mark right and left, but other than that perfectly symmetrical. Too bad they don't make those anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8113.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8113.jpg" alt="Sony MDR-CD770">
&lt;/a>The absolute best set of earphones I've ever had, and in fact still own after some odd 20 years, is a set of &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_6730518148">Sony MDR-CD770 Digital Reference&lt;/a> earphones. They (still) sound amazing, you feel like you can point out the location of every instrument in the band you're listening too, like they were in the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem with these are that they are big, expensive, and fragile. You won't be taking these with you when you're on vacation. They wouldn't survive the suitcase, and they're impossible when you are trying to lay your head down to sleep while listening to good music. Even if you did, you'd never wake up again, being strangled by the many meters of audio cable dangling off of your left ear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you're sitting at home on the couch, these will beat the * out of any soundsystem anyday, without annoying the neighbours. You'll be amazed at how good a high-bitrate AAC track sounds comming out of your iPod.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No Such Thing: Harddisk Warranty</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/24/no-such-thing-harddisk-warranty/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2007 19:54:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/24/no-such-thing-harddisk-warranty/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A while ago the drives in my fileserver (PPC Mac Mini) began dying on me, one after one. The disks were somewhat old (approx. 4 years) so I replaced them with 2 new Maxtor 500GB USB drives, and restored all data from my backups. The server came up and looked and worked like it had never died, but now had more diskspace.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few months of trouble free operation, one of the Maxtor disks seemed to have died this morning. I had kept the receipt, so I thought I'd get the drive and bring it in for repairs, because after all, this is well within the warranty period. While disconnecting the drive, it occured to me that I could never bring that harddisk in for repairs, particularly if I was not able to access it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Why? Because of the data on that disk. My iTunes library, purchased software and licenses, family pictures and taxes, everything is on there. Sure I have a backup, but what are the people in the store going to do with my data? No matter how you think about it, the disk is probably going to be checked by a store employee, and maybe later by a technician at the repair shop. Who's to say that these people don't steal my data?
&lt;p>The easiest target would be &amp;quot;casually copying&amp;quot; my music because that's what people do nowadays without seeing any harm in it. On my disk are more than a few iTunes DRM-free tracks which can be copied off there. These tracks are not DRM-ed, but they do contain information about me purchasing them. Should these tracks be found on the internet, the problem is mine, because I can never prove that I did &lt;em>not&lt;/em> put them there. Still my name is in there. This is the simplest scenario, but imagine what a clever person could do with your tax forms, or your personal foto's, or legally bought license keys...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole point is, that there effectively is no such thing as harddisk warranty, because you can't turn in your disk exactly for the reasons described above. After realizing this, the only tactics I can advise are:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. 8% of all harddisks die within the first 2 years of operation, according to some [research done by Google](http://tastyresearch.wordpress.com/2007/08/09/hard-drive-failure-statistics-at-google/) on a large set of disks. Harddisks do not die because of heat or use. So the only thing you can do after you buy a harddisk, is test it by writing to all sectors, erasing, and making some partitions with useless data. You can use [Disk Utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_Utility) for this for example.
2. After you've tested it and it prooved to be working, start using the disk normally and hope that noting happens. Backup. Backupbackup. Backup. Backup. I have absolutely no mercy for people who did not make backups. Don't call me if you loose data because you did not have backup plan. Backups are the Airbags, seatbelts and bullrack of your computer.
3. Start saving money for a replacement disk.
4. When the disk dies within the warranty period, try to erase it by writing bit patterns to it with the [Disk Utility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_Utility). If this succeeds and you are satisfied that your data is [erased to a reasonable degree](http://www.whitecanyon.com/newsletter-hard-drive-erase-multiple-overwrites.php#Article), go find your receipt, go to the store and try to get it repaired.
5. Bullet 4 is very unlikely to happen, because if you can write bits to a drive, you can use it. So, by the time you read this, the drive probably contains sensitive data, but you can't access the drive. No way to delete data there. The only option you have now is to [Slag your Drive](http://driveslag.eecue.com/), get the money you saved for a new one and buy a new one. Chances are that you can buy a bigger drive for the same money.
6. Restore your backups on the new drive and start saving for your next one.
7. Always try to use your new drive as the backup drive, and your old drive as the data drive. This gives you the advantage of your backup drive not being likely to fail, and because it is bigger, will easily hold (multiple) copies of the data stored on your data drive.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Back to my faulty drive: I connected it to my desktop Mac Mini (Intel) and it mounted, and did not seem to have any problems at all. I ran a diskcheck and listened to it for a while. No problems, nice sound. I reconnected it to the fileserver. Every sign of the problems I had earlier dissapeared. The only thing I could think of is to remove the cheap Trust USB hub because I ad USB trouble a few weeks ago, and I was suspecting that the drive access troubles could very well be caused by the cheap hub. Let's see if that does the trick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One other thing to remember, is that CD's and DVD's written on a computer &lt;a href="http://forums.cnet.com/5208-10149_102-0.html?forumID=7&amp;amp;threadID=152618&amp;amp;messageID=1698511">will not hold their data forever&lt;/a>, so they are too unreliable as backup media. A second harddisk is more reliable, because the magnetic information can be retrieved long after it has been written. Personally I backup to a spare harddisk daily (automatic) and every once in a while I do a manual backup to a third drive just to ease my mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For good measure I have an automatic off-site backup in the making, and I have a proof of concept working where I share an AFP:// share over an SSL connection, and backup into an encrypted DMG at the remote location. The owner of the remote computer can not see my data, and by only connecting with private/public keys using SSL the data is fairly safe from being stolen. The scripts need polishing, but in effect are no different than my local daily incremental rsync backup. I will always have an extra copy stored far away from my home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even a fire does not hurt me now, and scanning important documents becomes interesting, beause even if they get lost in a fire, you can &amp;quot;prove&amp;quot; to the insurance company that you had a policy, how much it was worth and what the insurancenumber was.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy Birthday!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/24/happy-birthday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2007 20:36:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/24/happy-birthday/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I know you've been playing with your ultra-cool iPhones, but did you realize that it only is 6 years ago that Apple showed is the first iPod? It's amazing how fast technology advances nowadays. Today I read that 128GB flashdrives are not far away, so how about an 128GB iPhone, or even a MacBook with a solid state disk? We've got a nice future ahead...&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Meanwhile, you can watch Steve announce the first ever iPod, and notice the difference with the existing devices at that time. It's not strange that the iPod changed the way people listen to music.

&lt;p>Since Sony invented the walkman, the trains, trams and busses have been flooding with people wearing earphones. At first, they irritated everybody with the &amp;quot;ts...ts...ts...ts...ts...ts...ts...&amp;quot; sound comming out of their ears, and now, many early walkman owners are starting to show hearing problems. The European Union has stepped in to protect our ears, and have set some limits to how much sound a personal music device can produce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory this is a terrific idea, but in practice, it doesn't work. Most manufacturers, like Apple are simply limiting the absolute maximum the device can use by measuring how loud a very loud mp3 plays at max volume. Then, they apply a software cap on the volume slider and that's that. As a side effect, people who like to listen to inheritly low-volume music (classical music or some talkshow podcasts) are very limited in where they can use this device.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I have an 8GB iPod nano myself (a.k.a. the "second generation"), and I am having trouble hearing the voices of a podcast when walking on the street. Most music has a sort-of-okay volume level, but this particular podcast I'm listening is very low on volume. Because it is a news podcast, I don't have the time, or patience, to manually manipulate the audio level of this podcast every single day before synchronizing it to my nano.
&lt;p>Today I found &lt;a href="http://gopod.free-go.net/">GoPod&lt;/a>, a tool which can remove the volume limit on many iPod models. This process is called &amp;quot;uncapping&amp;quot; the volume. I'm on an Intel mac, and even found someone who has compiled it &lt;a href="http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=29548">for Intel Macs&lt;/a> (not available on the original site). After some fiddling with it, I found that it didn't work with my iPod nano. In a search on the internet, I found that the 2nd generation nanos were not supported by GoPod because the developers had not figured out how to do this for the 2nd generation. Aperantly it is not that simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When entering &lt;a href="http://www.ipodhacks.com/forums/showpost.php?p=47438&amp;amp;postcount=172">diagnostic mode&lt;/a>, you can make the iPod produce a really loud 1KHz tone, which shows that the nano is capable of much more than Apple is showing you. The writers of the GoPod software also found the regional strings interesting, and everybody started posting:&lt;/p>

So far, the regional codes have not helped solving the problem. The GoPod people are still working on a hack, meanwhile the only options you have are the following:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Sell your European (capped) iPod and buy a new one from the US, make sure it is a US version. Maybe this is the moment to upgrade to that nice new generation nano :-)
2. Buy isolating in-ear headphones like the [Sony Fontopia](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-EX51LP-Fontopia-Headphones/dp/B000095SB6), or theÂ  [Sennheiser cx300,](http://www.sennheiser.nl/nl/icm_nl.nsf/root/500830) or theÂ  [Shure E2c](http://www.shure.com/PersonalAudio/Products/Earphones/ESeries/us_pa_E2c_content). Isolating in-ear phones will cost you anywhere between 30 and 100 euros.
3. Buy a set of [earjams](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/earjams) to turn your iPod earphones into in-ear earphones. The cheapest, but maybe also clumsiest solution.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that the first option is the most expensive, but actually solves the output voltage problem some people are experiencing when connecting the iPod to other hardware like amplifiers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iPhone opens up to developers</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/18/iphone-opens-up-to-developers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2007 20:40:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/18/iphone-opens-up-to-developers/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Finally, the word is out. Apple (Steve) has announced at the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/">&amp;quot;hot news feed&amp;quot;&lt;/a> that the iPhone (and iPod touch) will be opened up to developers in February 2008. I think this is a wise decision. In stead of fighting developers, bricking phones and constantly being at the defense, the effort of Apple is much better put to use by working together with the (free, unpayed, expert-level, hours-on-end-concentrating, 24/7) programmers out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>Steve wrote an open letter, which I'll quote here because you can not direct-link to posts in the &amp;quot;hot news&amp;quot; feed of Apple. On 17 October 2007 Steve wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>&amp;quot;Third Party Applications on the iPhone&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Let me just say it: We want native third party applications on the iPhone, and we plan to have an SDK in developersâ hands in February. We are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our users. With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best mobile platform ever for developers.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>It will take until February to release an SDK because weâre trying to do two diametrically opposed things at onceâprovide an advanced and open platform to developers while at the same time protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, privacy attacks, etc. This is no easy task. Some claim that viruses and malware are not a problem on mobile phonesâthis is simply not true. There have been serious viruses on other mobile phones already, including some that silently spread from phone to phone over the cell network. As our phones become more powerful, these malicious programs will become more dangerous. And since the iPhone is the most advanced phone ever, it will be a highly visible target.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Some companies are already taking action. Nokia, for example, is not allowing any applications to be loaded onto some of their newest phones unless they have a digital signature that can be traced back to a known developer. While this makes such a phone less than âtotally open,â we believe it is a step in the right direction. We are working on an advanced system which will offer developers broad access to natively program the iPhoneâs amazing software platform while at the same time protecting users from malicious programs.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We think a few months of patience now will be rewarded by many years of great third party applications running on safe and reliable iPhones.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Steve&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>P.S.: The SDK will also allow developers to create applications for iPod touch. [Oct 17, 2007]&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really hope that Apple will also open up the iPod cables again, for a minute out there Apple seemed to be forgotten what their initial market strategy was (and should be): Compete by designing the best product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've found Microsoft products to be restrictive, as opposed to Apple's products being liberating. Microsoft makes me want to pirate stuff, Apple makes me want to pay for the great solution they have. Microsoft tries to charge you bigtime, and in return give you long serialnumbers, &amp;quot;authenticity checks&amp;quot;, and a lot of problems and bugs along with a piece of software that does not solve your problem or works like advertised (Vista, anyone?). Apple simply offers the best solution you could possibly imagine, (almost) without (noticable) copy restrictions, at a fair price. It will feel like money well spent, and almost always actually works &lt;em>better&lt;/em> than advertised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why all of a sudden Apple wants to be in the restrictive game is a complete mistery to me, and I hope they'll see the error of their ways soon...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Essential Color Design Tool</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/15/essential-color-design-tool/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2007 19:59:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/10/15/essential-color-design-tool/</guid><description>
&lt;p>For those people out there designing user interfaces, web frontends or anything else displayed on a screen: About 8% of all males are color blind. This could mean that because of a simple color choice, 8% of your target audience (customers) could have serious difficulty in using your design. 5% of all males can't distinguish green from red, although they are regarded as high contrast to eachother.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do you want to test how your design looks to colorblind people? Now you can, with &lt;a href="http://colororacle.cartography.ch/">Color Oracle&lt;/a>, a tool for Mac OSX and Windows which transposes the colors of your screen to reflect what it would look like if you were color blind. In fact, it can simulate 3 different kinds of color blindness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the site: &lt;em>&amp;quot;Color Oracle takes the guesswork out of designing for color blindness by showing you in real time what people with common color vision impairments will see. Color Oracle applies a full screen color filter to art you are designing â independently of the software that you are using.

&lt;p>Since Wordpress has a 50MB space limit for images uploaded to the blog, I was looking for a place to host my galleries. Some friends of mine have &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr&lt;/a> accounts but I really hate it's cluttered and non-intuitive user interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday evening I found a very good alternative to Flickr, which actually is much cooler. It has all the features Flickr has, but it's user interface is much, much more intuitive, and less cluttered. It's fast, free and has a very cool upload feature which lets you edit the photo's as they're uploading! It's an amaing feature you'd have to see for yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And where can you find all this wonderfull stuff? It's at &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/">www.23hq.com&lt;/a>. Try it out, it's completely free, has no userspace or download limitation, and no spam is sent to you. The only limitation to free accounts is that you can upload maximum 30 photo's per month. But don't worry, you can upload 300 photo's the first week to get your account started.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Hi, just a quick reminder to myself and users of the AFP protocol (Apple File Protocol) who are wondering why it is not working. For some strange reason, if you start messing (deleting) the &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot; folder of any user which is on the system providing the AFP share, you will break the AFP protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I just deleted the Public folder from user A because I didn't want that user to have one. When I tried to connect to the server with user B, I got an AFP error. When I removed user A from the system, AFP worked again. I still have to figure out how to granulary disable drop boxes in the future, for now I'll leave them be I guess.
&lt;p>Why all this hassle? Renewed interest in remote backup I guess. I just found out that:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * You can easily tunnel AFP over SSH
* If you mount a remote 8GB AES encrypted DMG file, the file will not be transferred in its entirety over the network connection
* If you write 100kB into the mounted 8GB DMG, it does not write 8GB, but only 100kb+directory update.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>According to these observations, it should be able to make a 200GB DMG file on a remote machine, tunnel AFP over SSH and access it as a local disk with reaonable performance, even over an ADSL connection. This will pave the way for an automated rsync backup solution which could actually work, without special tooling or complex scripting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>1 week Gran Canaria</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/09/27/1-week-gran-canaria/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Sep 2007 19:06:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/09/27/1-week-gran-canaria/</guid><description>

&lt;p>If you've ever had the &amp;quot;pleasure&amp;quot; of configuring and sharing a printer between Windows machines, you probably know how tedious it is to get one machine to send a print job to the printer connected to another machine. And don't even get me started on how to do that on a Linux machine, or any mix of these two systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Ever since I migrated from Windows to Mac, I had been avoiding the printer sharing thing. The Ethernet printerserver I bought in my PC days only came with Windows bloatware, so that was a no-go. The Epson Stylus 915 worked nicely, connected with USB to my Mac Mini, so I had no need to solve that problem. My wife however still has a Windows laptop, and every now and then she would send me documents by mail which I then would print for her. Not ideal, but it saved me the stress and trouble of struggling with Windows to get it to talk to a Mac printer.
&lt;p>Today I discovered that I had it all wrong. Apple makes this wonderful little (2MB) piece of software called &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.html">Bonjour for Windows&lt;/a> which solved the whole printer sharing thing I had been putting off in about 6 mouseclicks! Share the printer on the Mac (about 2 clicks), download and install Bonjour on the Windows (about 2 clicks), and run the Printer wizzard that shows up (also 2 clicks). I had a Windows Testpage rolling out the printer before I knew it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What a good friend pointed out on the phone was something I hadn't realized: &lt;em>&amp;quot;See, you can actually make good software running on Windows, and it doesn't have to come on 4 DVD's. It's just that they don't care&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. Well, Apple does care, and they did a brilliant job at it. Small package, simple interface, no fuss, just works, and is good looking too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm very happy I did this, and in fact I'm going to print another testpage, just for the fun of it. On my Apple I am used to be able to edit video, audio, photo's and all at the same time. On Windows I'm glad I can print a testpage. See the difference? (for insiders: at work I'm glad to be able to receive a phonecall ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Disable Windows Native Zip support</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/09/11/disable-windows-native-zip-support/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2007 06:39:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/09/11/disable-windows-native-zip-support/</guid><description>
&lt;p>If you have large or many zipfiles in a folder, windows seems to lock up when opening the folder containing the zipfiles. This is because Windows is &amp;quot;smart&amp;quot; and decides to pre-scan the zipfiles and display them as folders. Installing free zip tools like &lt;a href="http://www.zipgenius.it/eng/index.php">zipgenius&lt;/a> will not change this behaviour, although you would expect that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To unregister the Windows zipfile support service, use the following command (Start -&amp;gt; Run...):
regsvr32 /u zipfldr&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable the Windows zipfile support again (I can't imagine why), use the command:
regsvr32 zipfldr&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_7615.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_7615.thumbnail.jpg" alt="o_img_7615.jpg">
&lt;/a>Past few weeks I noticed that the spindle bearings of my lathe were becomming warmer than I liked, particularly when working with higher rpm. Last weekend I decided to take the spindle out, clean the old grease out, and rebuilding it. It turned out to be more work than I expected. The tight fit of the pully made me use the hammer-and-wood trick on the spindle, which I did not like. After a few hours of tapping and fiddling, the pully came of. The spindle gear and the left hand bearing were no fun job either.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, the whole thing is apart now, and I cleaned out all the grease. I test-fitted the spindle sundaynight, but I can feel a slight &amp;quot;bump&amp;quot; when turning it, I think the grease must have picked up some dirt, most likely a wood chip from the bench. So I have to take it apart again, it has to be perfectly smooth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After I re-fit the spindle, I have to adjust it with my micrometer to have a play of between 0.004 and 0.005 mm, no more, and no less, while being able to turn it by hand. Sounds like an interesting excercise which will take up more than a few minutes :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is a long time since I read this stuff, but I &lt;a href="http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=64&amp;amp;id=11#article">stumbled upon a paper &lt;/a>discussing the non-executable stack on OSX (a trick to prevent buffer/stack overflow exploits). Ah, the good old days. And with all this markup, it's good to see that Phrack magazine stuck to their format. It's still the same as over 20 years ago... Well written articles, focussed on correctness and content, for the coders out there who are not afraid experimenting with some assembly. The amount of (nightly) hours that go into the research and proof of these articles are unbelievable, and it shows.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm afraid the years of Java have eroded my assembly knowledge, it's hard to keep up with the paper. But I loved to skim through the mov's, jne and jnz's, and the great comments. New young developers don't even learn how to write assembly anymore, the spoiled brats... :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more trips down memory lane, also check the Dutch &lt;a href="http://www.hacktic.nl/">Hack-Tic magazine&lt;/a>. Someone actually scanned all the pages every written in Hacktic. See if you can find the first XS4ALL machine in there... Too bad that they didn't have photo's of te &amp;quot;Hacking at the end of the Universe&amp;quot; in 1993, I really liked that one. I did found the &lt;a href="http://www.well.com:70/0/hacking/hack-tic/galac.hac">invitation&lt;/a> online, and Fransisco wrote a &lt;a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~fvjole/archief/artikelen/Volkskrant/1993/heu.html">nice article&lt;/a> for the Volkskrant.

&lt;p>Wherever I go, my iPod nano goes. With a &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; disk like on the nano, it's sort of important to make sure you are carrying the tracks you'll want to hear. I have a couple of smart playlists, and leave the rest to iTunes. Syncing takes less than a minute, is fully automatic and I'm very happy with the results every time.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_ipod-smart-playlists.jpg" alt="Smart Playlists">
Some people may be interested in how I organized this, so they can use some of these ideas themselves. On the left, you can see the smart playlists I use to fill my 8GB nano. I have placed these in a seperate folder to seperate them from all the other playlists I use to manage my iTunes collection with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there is the smart naming of the lists. Try to name your smart playlists so you can tell how they're built and what they contain. Looking at my lists, you can tell I only have 3 star rated songs and up on my iPod, unread books, and a seperate list containing tracks I haven't played or rated yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see my playlists are based on ratings. This is a personal choice, and only works on a good rating convention. To be able to build reliable lists based on ratings, try to conform yourself to rules. Mine are:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * **1 Star rating**: Never,ever play this track again. It sucks bigtime, or can't even be qualified as music. By doing this trick, you I effectively &amp;quot;delete&amp;quot; tracks right from the rating screen while playing a track. In iTunes I can later easily delete them when diskspace becomes a problem, but for how I keep them to keep my albums complete.
* **2 Star rating**: Not too good, don't play these too often. 2 star songs are currently not even transferred to my iPod.
* **3 Star rating**: This song is okay, I could listen to a radio station all day if it played songs with 3 star ratings
* **4 Star rating**: This is a good enough song to sit down to listen to. I can play it 2 times in a row without getting bored
* **5 Star rating**: If I had a single-song-ipod this track would be on it, and I would wear out the battery before putting another song on there. Effectively a &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot; song wherever I go.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_smart-3-star-radio-playlist.jpg">&lt;img src="o_smart-3-star-radio-playlist.jpg" alt="3 Star Radio playlist">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Translated: Rating is larger than 2 stars, limit to 2GB in size, select least recently played.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Above, you can see the 3 star radio trick. I found this idea on the web somewhere, and I liked it so I copied it, and added the size limitation. The playlist contains all 3 and more Stars rated songs, and is limited to 2 GB. Songs I played are swapped out during synchronization for ones I haven't heard for a while. The nice thing is that 4 Star rated songs in this list will also be in the 4 Star Radio list, but will only physically be on the iPod once. iTunes will never, ever physically put 2 instances of the same song on your iPod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is also the reason I can have 4 playlists of 2GB in size, plus some audiobooks and some other stuff (photo's) on my 8GB iPod. The 3, 4 and 5 star playlists don't add up 6 GB together, but far less because of the double tracks in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_smart-never-played-or-rated-playlist.jpg">&lt;img src="o_smart-never-played-or-rated-playlist.jpg" alt="Never played or rated">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Translated: Playcount is 0, and rating is less than 1 star, limit to 2GB in size, randomly selected.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be able to listen to new songs in your library and rate them, you'll need a playlist like this one. It's called &amp;quot;Never played (2GB)&amp;quot; and contains songs I have never heard and never rated. I rate most songs on my iPod, because it's within reach when listening to music. I use iTunes to stream music to the living room, and I'm not at the screen then so it's harder to rate songs that way. Nice thing about this list and the rating scheme I use is that 1 or 2 star songs are efectively deleted from my iPod. They don't show up in the playlists, and during synchronisation they are physically removed from the iPod to never return again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_smart-audiobook-playlist.jpg">&lt;img src="o_smart-audiobook-playlist.jpg" alt="Audiobook playlist">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Translated: Genre is Audiobook, Playcount is 0, limit to 5 items, select least recently added.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there are the audiobooks. I only actually have 1 I think, but this playlist makes sure I listen to my audiobooks in order of purchase. It puts the oldest 5 un&amp;quot;read&amp;quot; books on my iPod. Small disadvantage is that audiobooks need to have their genre set to &amp;quot;Audiobook&amp;quot; for this to work. I haven't found a trick to select audiobooks based on their extension (m4b) yet. Encoding type could work, but I also have AAC music tracks I bought in the iTunes store so the playlist would contain those aswell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next to the playlists above I have an important (dumb) playlist called &amp;quot;iPod musthaves&amp;quot;. This is a normal playlist, and any track I want on my iPod no matter what, I drag in there. I also have some lists called &amp;quot;blues&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;easy listening&amp;quot; but I don't use them that much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing which is not really perfect is the way I handle genres. Hardrock is next to classical music rightnow. I tried to get the genres right, but found that the whole &amp;quot;genre&amp;quot; idea does not apply to modern music. &amp;quot;Bluesy Rock&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rocky Blues&amp;quot; are overlapping genres, and are not usable to select tracks based on tempo or feeling. I have used &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/archive/2006/10/22/137730.aspx">Tangerine&lt;/a> to analyse the BPM of my tracks, but that still did not help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_no-more-genres.jpg">&lt;img src="o_no-more-genres.jpg" alt="No more Genres">
&lt;/a>To clean things up, I totally removed all crappy genre information from my library. Only a few very clear to identify songs with wierd genres I left to be able to find quicly. Proof is on the left. The information was indeed so crappy that I don't mis it a single day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I do mis is the ability to find music grouped by &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tempo&amp;quot;. In comes &lt;a href="http://www.crayonroom.com/moody.php">Moody (currently OSX only, Windows version in the making)&lt;/a>, a free iTunes plugin which allows to tag your tracks based on &amp;quot;Tempo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Energy&amp;quot;. You can then build smart playlists based on tempo and mood ranges. I've tried this on 30 or so tracks and it looks very promising. I hope I can find the time to mood tag a larger portion of my iTunes library. Trouble is that I can't do that on my iPod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To end this rather lengthy post, I can only encourage you to find your own &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, and translate that into smart playlists. This way iTunes &amp;quot;knows&amp;quot; what you want, and you'll be surprised about the great music you have in your library without knowing it. And if that's not enough, you can listen to your free podcasts for the daily news, music mixes or themed radio station.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_tomtomonev2-modded.jpg">&lt;img src="o_tomtomonev2-modded.jpg" alt="TomTom One v2 with earphone modification">
&lt;/a>TomTom decided to remove the earphone plug from their newer version One. This blog entry will describe how you can add your own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why would TomTom remove the earphone plug? There are a few simple reasons, one being that the new version has a slimmer formfactor with less room for plugs, and the other being that they probably don't want it to compete too much with the XL and Rider versions.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When my iPaq PDA died on me a few weeks ago, I was in desperate need of a new navigation system, and it already was clear that it had to be a TomTom, because I like the simple user interface and the clean look of the map and information when I'm driving. I also wanted to use it on my motorcycle, but wasn't ready to shell out 600 euro's for the occasional bike trip. Compared to the 600 euro's I had financial room to screw up three 200 euro TomTom Ones :-), so I had a go at one, and here's how it worked out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_tomtom-opened.jpg">&lt;img src="o_tomtom-opened.thumbnail.jpg" alt="TomTom Opened">
&lt;/a>First I opened it up and looked for a spot to place a 3.5mm earphone jack. There was (ver little) room at the bottom of the unit just behind the SD slot. An ordinary 3.5mm Jack wasn't going to fit, so I &lt;a href="o_ipaq-opened.jpg">canibalized my iPaq&lt;/a> for a small 3.5mm connector. Some careful measurements later, I decided it would fit, and started the electrical investigation before drilling holes in the unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_schema-tomtom.jpg">&lt;img src="o_schema-tomtom.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Schematic">
&lt;/a>I cut the read wire to the internal speaker and tried a couple of resistors in series with my earphones to get the right audio level. With the earphone's left and right speakers in series, a resistor of 470 Ohms sounded nice. Loud enough to be heard on a motorcycle, not so loud it would ruin my earbuds and -drums, and the volume slider controls the volume nicely. As you'll see this is an unorthodox connection for earbuds, since the ground lead is not connected. It is a matter of choice, you can connect the earbuds in parallel if you like, the impedance only changes a few Ohms. Compared to the 470 Ohms resistor you will probably not notice the difference. I didn't bother to change it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the 3.5mm plug from the iPaq there is a nice switch to disconnect the internal speaker. When I insert the earphones, the internal speaker is turned off, just like you'd expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With all planning and preparation done, it was now time to drill the hole in the TomTom case, the official point of no return. After the drilling, removing the battery and some fiddling with glue, the connector would not sit still while the glue was drying. I &lt;a href="o_connector-glue.jpg">taped it to the base&lt;/a> so the glue could settle. Be careful not to smear glue into the 3.5mm connector, the casing is not 100% closed because of it's size. You can actually see the metal of the connector for the left earphone piece in the picture. Glue that and you have a useless connector.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the glue dried, I reinstalled the battery with a fresh piece of double sided tape, and did the wiring properly. To prevent wires and the connector from hitting the copper shield of the circuit bord, I strategically &lt;a href="o_battery-back-in-place.jpg">placed some isolation tape&lt;/a> on the bare soldering joints. After that, the TomTom could be cloded up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_tomtom-mod-bottom.jpg">&lt;img src="o_tomtom-mod-bottom.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Modification, bottom view">
&lt;/a>As you can see on the right (click on it for larger image), the end result is pretty neat. As it turns out, the connector is not in a very different spot compared to the older model TomTom one. I tried it on my bike today, and it works nicely. I put the TomTom in a pocket of my jacket so I can not see or touch the display, but the spoken instructions are good enough compared to the money it cost me to do this (10 cents for the resistor, not counting the 3.5mm jack I got from my iPaq). You can hear the instructions while driving 120km/h on the freeway, unless you've got very loud pipes...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now go and roll your own!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Movie: The Worlds Fastest Indian</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/06/24/movie-the-worlds-fastest-indian/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jun 2007 20:04:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/06/24/movie-the-worlds-fastest-indian/</guid><description>

If you like motorcycles, wrenching and racing, you'll probably like &lt;a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412080/">this movie&lt;/a>. It's the life story of New Zealander Burt Munro, who spent years rebuilding a 1920 Indian motorcycle to help him set the land-speed world record at Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats in 1967.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The movie is nicely done, good quality video and audio with very good clean and calm cinematographics (much unlike you see nowadays). It's really a feel-good movie and makes you want Burt to succeed, even if you know that Burt really did so in real life. Anthony Hopkins really plays a very fine Burt Munro, and the producers have gone great lengths to make everything look like &lt;a href="http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=381">the real Burt Munro (the real story)&lt;/a>. The movie is a &amp;quot;bit besides the truth&amp;quot; every now and then, but not much and only to keep the story interesting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just found this funny page where you can take a &lt;a href="http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11">Programmer Personality Check&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My programmer personality type is &lt;strong>DHTB&lt;/strong>, which is explained as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_ You're a &lt;strong>D&lt;/strong>oer.
You are very quick at getting tasks done. You believe the outcome is the most important part of a task and the faster you can reach that outcome the better. After all, time is money._&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You like coding at a &lt;strong>H&lt;/strong>igh level.
The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You work best in a &lt;strong>T&lt;/strong>eam.
A good group is better than the sum of it's parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>You are a li&lt;strong>B&lt;/strong>eral programmer.
Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Houd Drachten open voor Dragracen</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/06/04/houd-drachten-open-voor-dragracen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2007 20:21:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/06/04/houd-drachten-open-voor-dragracen/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>So you are on a nice forum, discussing stuff with people you don't even know, or even don't care to get to knowing. They're just there to exchange thoughts with, and you don't even care that he's called &amp;quot;g0d1s.4.f4g&amp;quot; (or worse), and you even don't know if he is a she. Then in comes this guy and actually uses a readable name, tells you who he is, and talks like he talks in real life. No shorthand, no l33t sp33k, just plain English with typo's, like any normal, sane person. Even worse, he claims to be a celebrity, wanting to talk to some of his fans without all the security, press and other stuff.It sounds too good to be true, but for Die Hard fans out there, &lt;a href="http://www.freezedriedmovies.com/blog/index.php?/archives/81-Is-Bruce-Willis-a-talkbacker.html">it has really happened!&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://www.aintitcool.com/talkback_display/32511">thread itself&lt;/a> is rather lengthy (more than 1000 posts) and contains a lot of off-topic childish crap before the iCat moment, and after that contains even more crap with people posting useless &amp;quot;Oh my god&amp;quot; messages.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin&lt;/a> did a talk at Google campus in Februari last year. I recently stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://video.google.nl/videoplay?docid=-6909078385965257294">this video of his talk&lt;/a>, in which he explains to the Google people why Google sells.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He is very clear in explaining to technology people that &lt;strong>technology does not sell&lt;/strong>. It's technology that gives you a shot at marketing, nothing more. He makes some very good points which I'll try to summarize, because the video takes 48 minutes to watch :-)&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * People don't care about cool technology, they care about their problem being solved.
* When buying a product, people actually are buying a feeling or experience. Apple and Google are good examples of &amp;quot;solve the problem&amp;quot; products, which gives more &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;product&amp;quot;.
* People who buy &amp;quot;feeling&amp;quot; and are happy with that, will market the product for you. You just plant a seed, and if the product is good enough for the right people, it will sel itself
* You can only sell answers to people who have questions. The classic &amp;quot;tv show interruption commercial&amp;quot; is way less efficient than the [Add-Sense](https://www.google.com/adsense) commercials which presents relevant products to people who are searching.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When reading back this list, I think it is clear that Seth should speak to you, and not me ;-). My summary is lousy compared to the talk, maybe you're better of watching it. But the main conclusion for me still is that technology does not sell, nor does a product. It's the (happy) feeling people get from buying the product, making them want to tell other people about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He brings up a nice example still true today: If you wanted to search for something on the web, and go to &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo!&lt;/a>, you'll see a page with 100 links, and somewhere on the page (you have to look for it) is a search query entry field and a search button. When you go too &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/">Google&lt;/a>, it's very clear that you can search there. Almost no links, and the search functionality is in the middle of the page and everybody knows how to use it. This will make you come back at that page, and even better: If your friends wanted to search for something, you'd send them to Google, because you know they will know how to use that page, and not come bother you with questions about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google's page is becomming slightly more cluttered with links, I just hope they paid attention to Seth and will remove some soon. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Edit:&lt;/strong> This is also a nice addition of Seth. Only 10 minutes, about &lt;a href="http://video.google.nl/videoplay?docid=-4101280286098310645">stuff that's &amp;quot;broken&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. I whish people would not only watch it and laugh, but actually use it while designing/building/doing things!

&lt;p>Normally I try to steer clear of any politics, beliefs, or war on this blog, but I could not resist to link to this &lt;a href="http://video.google.nl/videoplay?docid=1296126090432829344">google video&lt;/a> I found, where Arab-American psychologist Wafa Sultan has some strong words to say to (extremist) Muslims on Al-Jazeera. Although broadcast in February 2006, I just noticed it, and I think she has some good points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personaly I don't believe you should interfere with people's lives if they're more than 10km away from your home (and they shouldn't interfere with yours). Say hello to your neighbour and ask how his/her day went. You'll notice that you can often help or solve your neighbours problems easily. Stop worrying about those people 10.000km away. If their neighbours follow your example, soon the world will be an even better place!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Digital Revolution</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/05/04/the-digital-revolution/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2007 20:39:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/05/04/the-digital-revolution/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Nice example of digital revolution and power to the people can be found at &lt;a href="http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-05-02-n67.html">http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2007-05-02-n67.html&lt;/a>. Let's hope manufacturers understand that people don't want to pay for crippled content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digital copies where copyright is removed are actually better than their DRM protected originals, which makes good willing people move to pirated content, like I &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/01/25/opening-itunes-to-other-players/">stated earlier&lt;/a>. The important sentence here being &lt;em>&amp;quot;If I buy a DVD, I have to watch a few minutes of copyrights notices and commercials, without being able to skip them. If I rip it, and re-write it, these notices are gone...&amp;quot;&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_ilove-apple-green.jpg">&lt;img src="o_ilove-apple-green.thumbnail.jpg" alt="I love my Apple">
&lt;/a>Lately Greenpeace has started a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/">campaign&lt;/a> against the usage of hazardous materials by Apple. The campain setup is friendly, nicely designed and urges Apple to choose materials which are less hazadous to the environment.As a spinoff of the Greenpeace campain all kinds of so called &amp;quot;journalists&amp;quot; have begun to put Apple on the &amp;quot;wrong end of the scale&amp;quot; of their &amp;quot;environment-o-meter&amp;quot;, and are happily writing doom articles about what will happen to your Karma if you buy any Apple product. But how environmentally unfriedly are Apple's computers really?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Let's say you believe the hype, and avoid Apple like the plague because of it's [environmentally unfriendly plastics](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple/), it's [huge pricetag](http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2006/04/25/debunking-the-price-myth-apple-vs-dell) and the risk of becomming a brainwashed [cult member](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_%28religious_practice%29) worshipping Apple for te rest of your life.
&lt;p>So you buy a &lt;a href="http://www.shivaranjan.com/shivaupload/trashcanpc/musor_02.jpg">shiny new $800 PC&lt;/a> to run Vista, with that new 8 zillion transistor processor, dual &amp;quot;Energy Star&amp;quot; power supply and an &amp;quot;Energy Star&amp;quot; screen. When you turn the computer on, it starts to warm up your room with the 80 Watts it's consuming. When you really put it through it's paces, it consumes up to 150 Watts, or more if you bought that superduper video card which is more of an &amp;quot;audio card&amp;quot; when the fan starts blowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a year of happy computing, your computer bogs down under the weight of all the &amp;quot;uninstalled&amp;quot; programs still on your drive. Vista 2 is released, and requires this all new Chipset to run, so you decide to buy a new PC. You give your old PC to your nephew, who totally turns it into an expensive $100 paper weight in 5 months, and it ends up in the trash because it can not be sold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously your new PC is way cooler than your old one, so it runs way hotter and uses more enery than ever. So there you are. Lot's of money spent, lot's of energy wasted, and lots of plastic in the environment, all in under a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your mother is also in the market for a new computer to read your emails and watch your photographs. You try to push her into buying a &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/25/1061663718447.html">&amp;quot;man's computer&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, but before you know it she falls for the slick designs and smoothtalk sales at the Apple store. She buys an &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She installs the heidonous toxic pastic bomb in her living room because &amp;quot;it looks lovely&amp;quot;. You put on your ear protection to turn it on, but your mother warns you that is already up and running. Yes that's right, you can't hear an Apple when it's on (and that goes for the fruit aswell). You don't believe her, and measure the &lt;a href="http://www.eworld.com/environment/energyefficiency/">power consumption&lt;/a>, which is less than half of the power of your PC, at comparabe system load. And the iMac has a built in screen to that, as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your mother uses the iMac for a year, and you stop by for your yearly 15 minute &amp;quot;tea-and-bisquits-with-mom&amp;quot; session only to discover that the iMac is still running as fast as last year, and is looking just as good as it did when it came out of the box. In fact, the next 2 yearly visits are the same. The iMac does not deteriorate, and judging by eBay, it holds it's value much longer than the average PC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each next version of the operating system hapilly runs on the &amp;quot;old hardware&amp;quot;, so your mother does not need to upgrade her hardware each time a new OS is released, apart from not needing to switch to the new OS anyway because it just works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having read all this, let's see how PCs and Macs compare:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >
&lt;p>PC
Mac&lt;/p>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
Life expectancy:
&lt;td valign="top" >1 year.
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >2 to 3 years.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
End of life:
&lt;td valign="top" >Ends up as worthless trash or power-gulping server.
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Gets sold to a happy new user for a good price.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
Power usage:
&lt;td valign="top" >More than 100 Watts (Pentium 4 PC without screen).
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Less than 50 Watts (Intel Core Duo Mac Mini without screen).
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
So which one is environmentally unfriendly I ask you? There are way more environmentally unfriendly PCs in the world, which use more energy and end up in the trash more often. I still remember how my electricity bill changed when I switched from PC to Mac, and how it is still running smoothly today.
&lt;p>Just a thought...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Disabling the Windows Clipboard</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/04/17/disabling-the-windows-clipboard/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2007 21:12:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/04/17/disabling-the-windows-clipboard/</guid><description>

&lt;p>If your are &amp;quot;fortunate&amp;quot; enough to have to delete a lot of file from a directory on a Unix system, you are likely to encounter the &amp;quot;Parameter List Too Long&amp;quot; problem. This problem is caused by Unix trying to replace the &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; you just used by all names in the directory. This list is then passed to the rm command, which complains that it can not handle that much parameters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get around this limitation, you have a couple of options:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Delete all files in the current directory&lt;/strong>
By far the fastest and most compatible way to delete all files in the current directory without recursing into subdirectories is:
ls | xargs rm
This is the fastest command, because xargs makes sure the maximum allowed number of parameters is passed to rm, resulting in fewer calls/startups to rm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Delete all files in the current directory and all subdirectories&lt;/strong>
To delete files not only from the current, but also from all subdirectories, use
find . -name &amp;quot;*&amp;quot; -exec rm -rf {} ;
This is somewhat slower, since rm is executed seperately for each file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Above commands are tested on AIX and Linux.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Thoughts on Widgets, Gadgets, Screenlets</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/04/11/thoughts-on-widgets-gadgets-screenlets/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Apr 2007 21:14:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/04/11/thoughts-on-widgets-gadgets-screenlets/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Just now, I was listening to the &lt;a href="http://javaposse.com/">Java Posse podcast&lt;/a> about the ab5k screenlet framework for Java, and I am finally convinced that software developers are a bunch of crazy, unrealistic, memory-hungry, cpu cycle stealers and by lack of normal people telling them otherwise are proud of it, too. The problem? Look at this list (no particular order):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [Linux screenlets or applets](http://kde.org/screenshots/images/3.5/35-superkaramba.png)
* [Windows Sidebar Gadgets](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/sidebargadgets.mspx)
* [Apple Dashboard Widgets](http://developer.apple.com/macosx/dashboard.html)
* [Google Desktop Gadgets](http://desktop.google.com/nl/?utm_campaign=nl&amp;amp;utm_source=nl-ha-emea-nl-google&amp;amp;utm_medium=ha&amp;amp;utm_term=google%20widgets)
* [Yahoo Widgets](http://widgets.yahoo.com/)
* and recently added: [ab5k.org java screenlets](http://www.ab5k.org/)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;!-- more -->As you can see, this list shows what modern OS's are offering to the user as an extra desktop with little applications on them like clocks, calculators, rss readers or whatever small tool you can think of. Aside from having a polished look and feel, looking good in screenshots, and -in the case of OSX- animations, all these share the same problems:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Usage of CPU cycles while not visible/used (and I don't care how few, there are some!)
* Usage of wired memory (memory which is not swapped out to disk for windows users), even while being inactive
* Slow loading times when restoring swapped-out widgets (memory swapped to disk which needs to be loaded back into memory)
* While resembling in name (screenlets, widgets, gadgets) not really portable between systems (although ab5k is about to solve that one)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I was triggered by the &lt;a href="http://javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=201631">Java Posse podcast on ab5k&lt;/a>, where one of the developers said that when the screenlet container was swapped out, it &amp;quot;only&amp;quot; used 24 megs of memory. That 24 megs could be just that 24 meg which makes windows swap out Photoshop to disk. 24 megs is a considerable amount of memory, for something which does absolutely nothing. An argument for *lets is probably the fast load time, but if all of them get swapped out, it would be just as fast just to start them, wouldn't it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my Mac, the dashboard looks great, and the widgets do what they promise. But apart from using it simply because it was new, I really don't use it that much nowadays. Once the coolfactor wears off, you just want it to work, and I think I like it better to have my utilities on the desktop, where I am working, rather than on a seperate cool looking transparent overlay from which I can not drag and drop easily into an application on the desktop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another thing that I realized while listening is that a lot of the functionality of these widgets are developer driven, not end user driven. I think half of the widgets are build by tech-nerds, but only 10% of the widgets actually end up being used by normal end-users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My point is: Can we please stop using the dashboard containers and just build these utilities so they are normal, small, self-contained, fast loading applications which just do what they are designed for, and exit (as in: die and free up memory) when closed? I think this will free up a lot of memory on a lot of systems, and puts CPU cycles to a better use, giving the user more control of what the computer is doing for him, and what he doesn't want the computer to do for him. And if these utilities are in a self-contained package like Apple applications, people can actually uninstall them without leaving a lot of crap behind on the system. Say no to setup.exe!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess the faster computers we buy, the greedier developers get.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple and EMI follow up</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/04/03/apple-and-emi-follow-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2007 21:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/04/03/apple-and-emi-follow-up/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/steve-jobs-gets-it/">previous post&lt;/a> I told you that Steve Jobs wants to provide DRM-free music through iTunes, but was held back by music companies. Steve must have had a few long and hard talks, because now EMI and Apple are teaming up to provide high quality &lt;a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/02/drm.free.music.on.itunes/">DRM-free tracks through the iTunes music store&lt;/a>, priced at $1.30. The same track, in a lower sound quality, with DRM costs $0.99. For &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/02/what-those-thirty-cents-buy-you/">30 cents&lt;/a>, you get a track you can actually use, with a higher bitrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time this could be a trick by Apple to get around the legal issues currently being discussed about iTunes music not being available to other players than the iPod. Smart eh?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bummer, back to Photoshop</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/03/06/bummer-back-to-photoshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2007 21:18:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/03/06/bummer-back-to-photoshop/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I bought Photoshop Elements 4 a while ago, but didn't use it much since I didn't like the userinterface (dissapearing menus when you click on the desktop and such). Then came Lightroom public beta, the Photoshop killer. I haven't touched Photoshop since I installed Lightroom. But now... the Lightroom beta testing period is over. Since I haven't got 300 Euros to &amp;quot;splurge&amp;quot; on Lightroom, I guess I'm forced to learn to use Photoshop to process my photos now. Oh well... Let's see how that goes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The DRM discussion that was &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/steve-jobs-gets-it/">started by Steve Jobs&lt;/a> is generating some interesting ripples in the music business pond.

&lt;p>Remember my rant on copy protection in the post about &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/archive/2007/01/25.aspx">opening iTunes to other players&lt;/a>? All the things record and movie companies tried the last few years has only encouraged people to rip, copy and distribute illegal media instead. It turns out that Steve Jobs also thinks that DRM is not the answer, according to bloomberg. Steve Jobs has sent a letter to the four largest music companies, in which he &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a_m4XNHva3IE&amp;amp;refer=home">Asks Music Labels To End Copyright Protection&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure it might sound bad when you have serious record company stock options, but the idea is not so dumb as it sounds. For years, Apple software has been reasonably priced, and of good quality. You can buy it online without too much hassle. Result: There is not much illegal Mac software out there. This will surprise the Windows user, who is acustomed to running all kinds of illegal software, up until the point they are practically forced to continue to do so, because they have all their content stored in propriatary formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like Apple's way of doing things much more: Deliver good quality products, ask reasonable prices, and trust your users (up until a point ofcourse ;-). In return, Mac users are often more like &amp;quot;fans&amp;quot; than customers, because they don't feel like they've been &amp;quot;had&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think loosing the copy right protection and then lowering the prices on music is a good thing. The iTunes music store is an easy store to search music or other content in, and does not force millions of tracks onto you (like your friend with the 200GB music library on an USB disk does). Who cares if I have to pay a few cents for a track if I feel like iTunes has helped me find that track? The feeling shifts more to like &amp;quot;paying for the service&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;paying for the track&amp;quot; which is probably what we all look for. As an added value, we have the old &amp;quot;it's my product, I bought it&amp;quot; feeling back, where we can do with the content as we like because we payed for it. We are no longer restricted to stupid things as &amp;quot;you can listen this track only twice on your Zune before it will selfdestruct&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> More information and the response from Norway is &lt;a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/02/06/norway.responds.to.jobs/">online at MacNN&lt;/a>. Norway showing it does not understand iTunes at all, because you can configure iTunes to store the files at a location of your destination, which can ultimately be any (large enough) USB disk, which in turn can be a media player device :-) .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use iTunes with *ANY* mp3 player</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/02/01/use-itunes-with-any-mp3-player/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2007 21:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/02/01/use-itunes-with-any-mp3-player/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Many years ago, I bought an &lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Jens_of_Sweden_MP_100_256MB/4514-6490_7-30420028.html">iBead Jens of Sweden MP-100&lt;/a>. At the time I was a Windows/Linux user and everything was fine. Now that I'm a Mac user, syncing tracks to my trusty USB mp3 player is a bit harder. I had to copy tracks by hand, and when two tracks had the same title the copy would fail. THis was all very irritating. I am saving for an iPod nano, but until I get one I'm stuck with the USB copy tricks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But not anymore, 5 minutes ago I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.nesfield.co.uk/synctunes/">SyncTunes&lt;/a>, a free Mac OSX application which can sync iTunes playlists to &lt;strong>any&lt;/strong> drive as long as it's available on your desktop. This means that any drive that mounts as a removable drive (USB memory sticks, PDA's, Sony PSP's...) can be used to sync the playlist to. The only catch is that you have to make the playlist fit onto the drive (in size). This can be easily done by creating a smart playlist in iTunes which is limited in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tested syncing some of my playlists (through a size-limiting playlist) and it works like a charm. Size limiting playlists are also the thing to use if you do have an iPod, and want some control on how many space is used by pop music, and how many space is used by rock. I'm a happy camper now, and in no hurry to buy an iPod (but that &lt;a href="//store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?family=iPodnano">8GB red nano&lt;/a> sure looks tempting).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Java 5 BigDecimal.toString() and Oracle 10g jdbc</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/31/java-5-bigdecimaltostring-and-oracle-10g-jdbc/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2007 21:30:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/31/java-5-bigdecimaltostring-and-oracle-10g-jdbc/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Yesterday a collegue of mine discovered a very ugly problem when storing BigDecimals from a Java 1.5 program into an Oracle 10g database. Not by experience, but by reading the article at &lt;a href="http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t88158.html">http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t88158.html&lt;/a>. We had not encountered the problem ourselves, but when passing the dredded 12500000 value to the BigDecimal constructor and passing it to the database, we discovered that we too were affected by this bug. So off I went to search a solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The root of the problem lies not only in the fact that the BigDecimal.toString() method behaviour has changed in Java 1.5, but also the way BigDecimals are constructed. The Oracle driver relies on a specific formatting of the BigDecimal.toString() method, and can not handle the output of the &amp;quot;new and improved&amp;quot; BigDecimal in Java 1.5. All discussions about not using toString() for passing values and flaming Oracle and/or Sun aside, we have no option but to fix the problem right now. Oracle promised to fix this problem not sooner than in release 11g, so waiting is not an option.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 1: Overriding BigDecimal.toString()&lt;/strong>
In our project, we use Ibatis. This gives us a nice handle to implement our own BigDecimalTypeHandler, where we can choose to do anything to the BigDecimal before storing it into the database, and revert that when retrieving it from the databse. One of the options we thought of was to override the BigDecimal's toString in an anonymous subclass inside our IbatisTypeHandler, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;
public void setParameter(PreparedStatement ps, int i,
Object parameter, String jdbcType)
throws SQLException {
BigDecimal colVal = new BigDecimal(
((BigDecimal)parameter).toPlainString()){
public String toString(){
return toPlainString();
}
};
ps.setBigDecimal(i, colVal);
}&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The anonymous subclass lets you add or change behaviour to an existing class without cluttering your codebase with a classfile which looks rather strange when places out of context. We tried various ways of locally changing the behaviour of BigDecimal to make it go into and out of the database in a way that our unittest would not know the difference, but at some point gave up. There is not really a good way to do this without compromising in scale or resolution in the conversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When using the setParameter described above, you ** will not** get a situation where originalBigDecimal.equals(storedBigDecimal) returns true. In most cases this will not be a very big problem, since originalBigDecimal.subtract(storedBigDecimal) will always return 0.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If somebody thinks of a way to store BigDecimals into the database and retrieving them in a way it is totally transparent to the caller (compared to JDK 1.4 behaviour) please feel free to post it here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Option 2: Loosing your BigDecimals **&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Perhaps this option had to be considered when thinking of using BigDecimals in the first place. BigDecimals are very awkward to calculate with, are relatively heavy both performance and memory wise. Very often they get converted to doubles before doing any calculations with them, which eliminates most of the reasons for using BigDecimals anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The easy way to loose only those BigDecimals which get stored in the Database, rewrite the typeHandler you just created into the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;
public void setParameter(PreparedStatement ps, int i,
Object parameter, String jdbcType)
throws SQLException {
throw new UnsupportedOperationException(
&amp;quot;Oracle can not handle Java 5 BigDecimals properly&amp;quot;);
}&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now, run all Unittest (you have unittests covering at least 80% of your software, don't you?) and replace BigDecimals with other appropriate datatypes where you see the UnsupportedOperation popup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reboot...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/29/reboot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2007 21:05:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/29/reboot/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today the Mac OS Software update popped up, and warned that these updates would require a reboot (about 80% of the updates do not require a reboot). I have gotten so used to not having reboot and hangup troubles that I almost was surprised to see that I needed to reboot. I use my Mac mini for editting foto's, video, recording TV programs, streaming music, programming, mail, and the usual webbrowsing. It is so quiet and uses so little power that I only power off the screen, and leave the Mac on. I noticed that I have not turned it off for the past 20 days:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;rolf$ uptime

&lt;p>Not bad for a workstation eh? Glad I bought a Mac, it was worth every penny.

&lt;p>Today I found an &lt;a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&amp;amp;storyID=2007-01-25T155722Z_01_L25510487_RTRIDST_0_TECH-APPLE-ITUNES-NORWAY-DC.XML&amp;amp;WTmodLoc=TechInternet-C3-Technology-2">article about Norway suing Apple&lt;/a> because music bought in the iTunes store could not be played on a non-iPod music player. If Apple looses this legal attack, it would result in an even stranger digital rights management situation than we already have. &lt;!-- more -->First, let me tell you why I think the whole legal case would not be worth persuing anyway:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Music bought through iTunes is in the [AAC format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#How_AAC_works), which is an open standard format. Any modern player is capable of playing AAC files. The &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; lies in the way the songs are stored in an encrypted form invented by Apple, called [Fairplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay). Fairplay resticts the way you use and play the file, but only very limited: You can play a Fairplay encrypted file on your iPod, on up to 3 (three) authorized computers, and (here it comes) can be **copied to a standard audio CD any number of times**. Since when is this called &amp;quot;limiting&amp;quot;?
2. Buying DRM music from iTunes clearly has limitations. Apple is not hiding this fact, as Microsoft is not hiding the fact that WMA has almost the same limitations. Suppose there was no workaround available and you had to play the music on your iPod, you still could not complain. You can almost describe it as not being able to play CD's on your record player. You bough a CD, not a vinyl record, and you knew beforehand that it was not compatible with your record player.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>That said, I think the root cause of these type of lawsuits is often overlooked. It's the way people think about intelectual property and the traditional ways of selling copies where the author received a substantial part of the profits. In a digital age like ours, there is no &amp;quot;physical product&amp;quot;, which makes it very easy for me to give a file I bought to just about an individual out there, without me loosing the original file. The copies of the file are all of the same superiour quality, so re-distributing them is very interesting to anyone wanting to exchange or &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot; music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have allways thought of DRM of crippeling a file because people simply can not behave. The whole proces of crippeling audio and video files has just resulted in me doing the oposite of what the intent was. If I buy a DVD, I have to watch a few minutes of copyrights notices and commercials, without being able to skip them. If I rip it, and re-write it, these notices are gone, but I feel mistreated by the DVD company because I have to de-cripple my DVD's. This makes the ripped illegal copies much more interesting for me, because regardless of the price, I can just pop in the DVD, and watch the movie, like expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same goes for Audio, up to a certain point. When I buy music online, regardless if this is through the or &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/stores.aspx?lcid=809">any other WMA selling store&lt;/a>, the store dictates the way I use the audio file. As customer, I feel like I bought a file and I can do with it what I like. As store, they sell you the rights to listen te a recording in a restricted number of ways, a restricted number of times even. That's why I allways try to buy music on a normal audio CD. This gives me the ultimate solution to all problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. It is the original regording, in a non-lossy form. I can allways re-rip the audio in any bitrate I see fit for the purpose at hand.
2. I allways have the original and it will last for years as reliable backup. Storing it safely in a cupboard and never using (scratching) it, it will provide me with a 100% safe backup of my digital music library on my Mac, iPod, or USB memory stick player.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If it is not possible to get the music on a normal CD, I can allways resort to people who invent products like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn_%28software%29">Hymn (Hear Your Music aNywhere&lt;/a> to remove the DRM for me. As long as I do not copy the file, I see no harm in doing this because the DRM is there to prevent me from doing things I would not easily do anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think crippeling digital content is not the way to protect their content. There will always be people finding methods around this. Furthermore, the prices are very much like the pricing of their physical counterparts, which makes fro very unatractive products. Why would I buy a lossy, digitally crippled version of an audio track I can have on a non-lossy CD for the same price (per track)? The real problem is not being able to proscecute violators of the different copyright acts in various countries. What you actually want to verify is that the user of the audio file has paid some money to the original artist(s). That's the only problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if the stores selling these audio tracks just gave every song a serial number. No DRM, just a tracking number. The store can administrate which serial number was bought by whom. By doing this, officers at my door can just extract these ID's from my library, upload them to the store and see if I paid for them, or somebody else did. This will probably not be the case for 100% of my tracks (since somebody else could have bought it for me on another computer). To prevent overhead lets say that the law states that 80% of my bought songs should have been bought by myself. If more than 20% of my library is not accountable for, investigation is started and could result in me paying fines for every song in my library which is considered to be an &amp;quot;illegal copy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole sales model needs to be reinvented, and I think DRM is not the way to go. It has been around for long time, and I have never been tempted enough to buy a track, nor were any of my friends. As music stores go, the iTunes store is about the only store I &lt;em>would&lt;/em> buy tunes from, because this guarantees me that they will be playable on my machine and my music player. Apple is very maticulate about the correct functioning of their hard and software, much more so than Microsoft or any other smack-together-a-WMA-music-store out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somebody should sue CD labels for producing CDs which can not be played on a computer for exactly the same reasons as in all these other lawsuits. I bought music, and the store has no right deciding when I can do what with it or how many times (no pun intended). I understand they don't like illegal copies, but they can not punish me for making illegal copies before actually doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe music should just be free alltogether, and make it &amp;quot;donation-ware&amp;quot; or something alike. Most artists make more money in a single concert than all the years CD profits. You could see the CD as a commercial. Give it away for free, print the concert dates on it and make people go to your concert!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a way this is already what higher powers are doing for us. On every CD-writable I buy in the Netherlands, I pay a fee to &lt;a href="http://www.bumastemra.nl/en-US/Home.htm">buma-stemra&lt;/a>, because I could &lt;em>potentially&lt;/em> place (illegal) music on that CD. If I payed for it allready, then why not do it anyway? I have less and less problems with copying digital content with all these organisations charging fees and taxes for things I did not buy or am not intending to do. There was even a discussion going on about &lt;a href="http://www.portablegear.nl/nieuws/2/120/2533/Nederlands_belastingvoorstel_draait_MP3_de_nek_om.htm">adding mp3 taxes to harddisks&lt;/a> because you can place music in mp3 form on a harddisk. Is that sick or what?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the issue is covered by many others allready, and there are no new insights in this article. So I'll just return to my iTunes library, make a few backups and hope they'll never make playback of my tracks impossible...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lost Oracle SYS and SYSTEM password?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/16/lost-oracle-sys-and-system-password/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2007 21:09:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/16/lost-oracle-sys-and-system-password/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Method 2: Creating pwd file (Tested on Windows Oracle 8.1.7)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Stop the Oracle service of the instance you want to change the passwords of.
2. Find the PWD###.ora file for this instance, this is usuallly located atC:\oracle\ora81\database\, where ### is the SID of your database.
3. rename the PWD###.ora file to PWD###.ora.bak for obvious safety reasons.
4. Create a new pwd file by issuing the command:
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>orapwd file=C:\oracle\ora81\database\PWD###.ora password=XXXXX
where ### is the SID and XXXXX is the password you would like to use for the SYS and INTERNAL accounts.
5. Start the Oracle service for the instance you just fixed. You should be able to get in with the SYS user and change other passwords from there.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monokai</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/14/monokai/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2007 21:24:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/14/monokai/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_iphone-cingular.jpg">&lt;img src="o_iphone-cingular.thumbnail.jpg" alt="iPhone">
&lt;/a>I have been watching the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">Macworld 2007 keynote address&lt;/a> for the last 2 hours and all I can say is:...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jup, nothing. I am absolutely amazed by the way Apple has not only reinvented the phone (look ma, no keys!) but also the ipod (look ma, &lt;a href="http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/">coverflow&lt;/a>!), and maybe the most overlooked, but they reinvented the mouse!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of months ago, I was amazed at this &lt;a href="http://ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=j_han&amp;amp;flashEnabled=1">new userinterface&lt;/a> Jeff Han presented . It was touchscreen based, and very intuitive. He amazed the crowds with it. At the time me and my collegues guessed that he must have had several computers working in parallel to be able to facilitate this. Now, Apple actually integrated it into the phone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think a phone without keys sucks, and you think your blackberry is a great device, please take a look at the keynote presentation, I think you will want one of these. If you are too busy to sit for 2 hours watching this amazing device, or even too busy to watch the shortened version (on the same page, as the keynote, above), I'll list some of the highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Large (and I mean LARGE) touch sensitive display all over the front of the phone
* ipod functionality, syncing not only your music, but also your photos, movies and contacts automagically between your Mac and your phone
* Runs [Mac OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/index.html), Apples operating system shipped with all macs. (Yes REALLY runs it)
* Full, 100% normal internet browsing using a new version of [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/) (told you it runs OSX, didn't I?)
* Full [Google maps](http://maps.google.nl/) integration (not a crippled mobile phone version), enabeling you to view maps and satelite images on your phone, and integrates with your phonebook and other applications. Lookup where an address is, or search for the nearest Starbucks and directly phone a store from within the Google map (demo in keynote).
* Full rich text IMAP and POP3 email client with very easy to use onscreen keyboard with error correction
* Tilt sensor to enable to view anything in landscape mode by just holding your phone horizontally, providing widescreen movie viewing!
* Gesture based user interface, allowing you to navigate through the phone and zoom in and out on practically anything
* Quad band phone using GSM + EDGE standard. Currently only shipping with [Cingular and AT&amp;amp;T](http://www.cingular.com/home/) and a [free Yahoo! imap](https://login.yahoo.com/config/mail?.intl=us) account. Technically possible to use in Europe using any GSM network provider, but I don't know how the Cingular contract looks for Europe.
* Built in WIFI and bluetooth technology to connect to the internet or any network, and a bluetooth headset, and it does that seemlesly
* Random access voicemail (tap on the voicemail you want to hear)
* Priced at $499 for a 4GB model, and $599 for an 8 GB model, available in June in US, end of 2007 in Europe, and 2008 in Japan.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_iphone_home.gif">&lt;img src="o_iphone_home.thumbnail.gif" alt="iPhoneÂ unlocked">
&lt;/a>My list could go on and on, but these are probably the highlights you were looking for. I've seen &lt;a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve&lt;/a> using the iPhone, and the userinterface is a dream. If you own a Microsoft mouse with the &amp;quot;heavy scrollwheel&amp;quot; you will know what I mean when the iPhone scrolls through the lists by giving it a swing. Amazing to look at. The Core animation of OSX is in the phone, so everything tilts, swoops and zooms like on your desktop and it is really, really nice too look at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My guess is that by doing this and patenting it, the next step Apple will take is reinvent the desktop userinterface. Have your screen built into your desk, throw your keyboard away and touch the screen! It has been done before, but after you've seen the keynote you will agree with me that Apple can do it right this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been quite some time since I have been amazed by a product like this, although it will be a while before I own one because I'm afraid it will get stolen because of it's good looks. I'm afraid it will even push the iPod out of the market a little, and Zune will be dead and gone when the iPhone hits the market...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go and see the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">Macworld 2007 keynote address&lt;/a>, and see his Steveness improvise when his &amp;quot;Clicker's not working&amp;quot; just before he announces &amp;quot;Apple Computer Inc&amp;quot; is now going to be called just &amp;quot;Apple Inc&amp;quot;. Maybe Apple should ship this keynote on DVD. Seriously. Even if the only reason is seeing John Mayer perform &amp;quot;Gravity&amp;quot; live and unplugged at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'll hold on to my &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=GOOG">Google&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=AAPL">Apple shares&lt;/a> for a while I guess...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Waar was Miriam?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/07/waar-was-miriam/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jan 2007 21:29:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2007/01/07/waar-was-miriam/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>Hi, I just discovered oypo.nl, an online service for photographers to sell prints of their photographs. It's a simple concept, where a photographer uploads images, and the website sells prints of these images to anybody who orders them. Part of the commision is going back to the photographer, and to some extent the photographer can decide how expensive his photograps are to the public.Because opening an account is free, and because I think my photo's are WAY better than most of the material on oypo.nl, I decided to open an account just for fun. If you like to buy my photographs, take a look at them at&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The resolution of he shots should give good to very good results on near poster format, and I try to keep the choice simple by only uploading the interesting ones. Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nice Mac Tools</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/12/21/nice-mac-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 21 Dec 2006 15:30:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/12/21/nice-mac-tools/</guid><description>
&lt;p>As a Mac user, I have absolutely no problem editting, moving and viewing large video, audio and image files. There was one thing I missed though, and that is a tool which is able to quickly view a large JPG (like OSX's own preview) but then skip to the next image in the directory when selecting &amp;quot;next&amp;quot;. Today I have found just that tool, and it is a dream to work with. It called &lt;a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/19978">Xee&lt;/a> (not to be confused with the rather lame Xsee).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Xee loads jpg's blindingly fast from my remote fileserver. Then, using just the keyboard, I can easily zoom in, out, skip to the next or previous file in the directory, fit the image to screen, etc. After testing about 20 or so image viewers, It is absolutely the best image viewer I have found.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the search for Xee, I also encountered the &lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/frakes/MOSXPT/content/software.html">OSX Power Tools&lt;/a> page, which is a list of very handy utilities for the Mac, and from what I can see all of them are free to use (check license to be sure).&lt;/p>

Until you want WPA2(AES)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/12/07/airport-express-works-great-until-you-want-wpa2aes/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2006 15:35:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/12/07/airport-express-works-great-until-you-want-wpa2aes/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I recieved my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express&lt;/a> last tuesday and had it installed as a wireless audio connection for my stereo in a couple of minutes as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Plug the Airport Express in a wall outlet.
2. (Temporarily) connect it to the network using an UTP cable
3. Run the Airport Administration utility (forget the wizzard, it will not allow you to setup the airport as a client).
4. Setup the Airport Express to connect to your existing network (which was WEP encrypted at that time)
5. Unplug the Airport Express, take it to the living room and plug it into an outlet, and connect it to the stereo (look ma, no wires!)
6. Select the airtunes to be used as speaker device in iTunes and you're all set
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;!-- more -->So far, so good. I've enjoyed listening to my mp3's in the living room for a few days. I can see my Mac mini from the couch, and I can read the frontrow screen with the nice cover art, and can control playback with the apple remote. I also noted that I can select to use the Airport Extreme as well as the speakers connected to the mac simultaniously. The music is actually synchronized, so there is no "echo" when playing music from both speaker sets. Nice!
&lt;p>Today I decided to upgrade the encryption of the access point in the living room to WPA2 (or WPA with AES Rijndael encryption and reloading key groups every 5 minutes for the nerds out there). My Linksys WAP45G supports this, as well as all the wifi hardware I currently own (I checked). Everything was converted to WPA2 pretty easy, until I came to my new shiny toy, the Airport Extreme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent this whole evening trying to get it connect as a client to the WPA2 network, but to no avail. Other people are reporting similar problems. It just sits there blinking it's amber light. Luckaly I have an ethernet cable available near the stereo (network everywhere! wohoo!) so I decided to give up and connect the Airport Extreme to the network by cable. So now everything is working again&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The disadvantage I have right now is that I can not use the Airport Extreme anywhere in the house without wires. I'm not downgrading my security for now, I hope Apple solves this problem in a future release of the Airport Express firmware. They are usually pretty fast with fixes so I'm not that worried (yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More info on WEP, WPA and WPA2 can be found on wikipedia at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access&lt;/a>. And NO, WPA2 is NOT easy to crack, like I read on some forums. Damned wisenose hoax-starting scriptkiddies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not convinced? From an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">article about AES on Wikipedia&lt;/a>:
&lt;em>&amp;quot;The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>
So there. AES with 192 bit keys are secure enough for TOP SECRET documents for the US governement. Secure enough for your home? I guess so!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sidestep: I noted this little &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; on my desktop on how to set up the mac mini fileserver . I guess I need to finish that, since it is very intresting to see how simple it is to setup a quiet, low power fileserver with versioned backups, CVS server and the added security of the OSX operating system, for just over 300 Euros. I hope you'll be able to read about it soon on this blog.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ati SUCKS!

&lt;p>Just to share some frustration with you guys, I just spent 4 hours trying to update the Ati video drivers for my Mobility Radeon 9200 video card in my laptop from version 6.14 to 6.5. And all this just because Second Life crashes on my laptop every 3 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Ati installer just crashes because there is already an old version of the driver on the system. Any normal manufacturer would be able to upgrade the driver, no? No. This is a windows system, and even with the slightest sign of problenms, you end up digging forums where people have found how to edit the registry to get things done. And then it will still not work. Windows is so full of crap, I even found a driver cleaner tool. And no, that also did not work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can not wait to replace my shoddy PC laptop with an iBook or macbook pro. Mind you, this is an Acer Ferrari 3000 laptop I'm typing this on, which should be a decent laptop. But the Windows way just screws it all up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every 10 hours of PC, I spend 2 to 4 fixing problems or upgrading drivers. Every 10 hours of Mac, I spend 0 hours updating drivers and 0 hours fixing things. I see an easy winner here in the productivity departement....&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Stomwijzer</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/11/20/stomwijzer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Nov 2006 19:51:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/11/20/stomwijzer/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Follow these steps to create an &lt;a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux&lt;/a> &amp;quot;server&amp;quot; running a &lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres&lt;/a> database which allows non-local connections. You will need a machine with at least 10GB HD, bootable from CD-ROM, network card, and preferably more than 200MB RAM. Other than that, it can even be a Mac G4 if you like (just download the correct Ubuntu build).&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Download the [ISO image for Ubuntu 6.06.1 (Dapper Drake)](http://se.releases.ubuntu.com/6.06/). I chose the desktop version to have the graphic user interface to fall back on, I'm not a command-line typing machine.
2. Burn the ISO image to a CD-ROM, and startup your soon-to-be-database-server with it. To make the installation go smoothly, hook it up to a network with a DHCP server. You can configure the DHCP server to always deliver the same IP to your database server, which is often much easier than configuring all those stupid Linux config files all over the place.
3. Choose install values as if it were going to be your desktop. Follow the installer, don't try to &amp;quot;outsmart&amp;quot; it.
4. When it boots for the first time, log on and find the software updates on the top left of the screen. Install the updates. This may take a while but you don't have to babysit it. Wait for it to finish and reboot when it asks you to. Please note that your root password will be the same password as you used for creating your first user.
5. [optional] If you would like to be able to remote-connect to this machine using SSH, install the ssh server by typing in the following command on in a terminal window:
sudo apt-get install ssh openssh-server
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You should now be able to connect to your server remotely. If you installed SSH, you can now move the machine to it's final physical destination (a nice broomcloset or something)
6. Install postgres 8.1 (plus client) with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.1 postgresql-client-8.1
7. Change the password of the postgres user with the following commands (typing in red)
&amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;&amp;gt;sudo su postgres -c psql template1&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
template1=# &amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;&amp;gt;ALTER USER postgres WITH PASSWORD 'mySecret123Password';&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
template1=# &amp;lt;font color=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;&amp;gt;\q&amp;lt;/font&amp;gt;
8. Make postgres listen on all interfaces by editting the postgres.conf file. Edit the file with:
sudo pico /etc/postgresql/8.1/main/postgresql.conf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Change the line&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>#listen_addresses = 'localhost'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>to&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>listen_addresses = '*'
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In the same postgres.conf file, make sure the password encryption is turned on by changing the line&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>#password_encryption = on
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>to&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>password_encryption = on
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>and close the file.
9. Tell postgres which machines are allowed to connect. Edit the pg_hba.conf file (nice descriptive name, huh?) with the following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sudo pico /etc/postgresql/8.1/main/pg_hba.conf
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>and add the following lines to the end of the file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>#Allow all hosts on the same subnet to connect to this database server
host all all 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0 md5
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that my home network is a 192.168.0.* network. If yours is a 10.0.0.*, you know what to replace in the line above, right?
10. Make the postgres server restart and load the changes you've just made by using the command&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.1 restart
11. Check that it actually works by using the following telnet command from a different machine in your network:
telnet [postgresmachine] 5432
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If telnet responds with &amp;quot;Connection refused&amp;quot;, you have a problem (which I'm not going to cover here, sorry, just retry). If all went well, telnet will tell you that it's &amp;quot;Connected to [postgresmachine]&amp;quot;. You can start using it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Creating a working postgres server from a bare metal machine should take not much more than 1 hour or so. For me, it took 2 complete evenings because so few people are posting good step-by-step simple guides. 80% of the time you get redirected to a long, complete, cryptic information page on the postgres site, which by the time you've read completely through it, only solved half your problem. The other 20% of the time people are steering you in the wrong direction by making you edit the &amp;quot;inner guts&amp;quot; of your server, like the rc.d files and whatnot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun with your new database machine!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update: Replaced gedit with pico, this will work on an ssh session as well as a local terminal session. gedit is a graphical editor.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ibatis Nullpointer calling stored procedure</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/11/07/ibatis-nullpointer-calling-stored-procedure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2006 19:53:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/11/07/ibatis-nullpointer-calling-stored-procedure/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today, a collegue of mine had a really strange nullpointer problem trying to call a stored procedure in an Oracle 10 database using &lt;a href="http://ibatis.apache.org/javadownloads.html">iBATIS Java 2.2.0&lt;/a>. What she had was a normal JavaBean, like so:Â &lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>package com.rolfje.foo
public class BarBean {
private String barName;
private Long barId;
... setters/getters here ...
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>A straightforward parametermap:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;parameterMap class=&amp;quot;com.rolfje.foo.BarBean&amp;quot;
id=&amp;quot;barbeanMap&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;barName&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;parameter property=&amp;quot;barId&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/parameterMap&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>and a straightforward procedure mapping:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;procedure id=&amp;quot;insertBar&amp;quot; parameterMap=&amp;quot;barbeanMap&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
{ call store_bar (
?,?)
}
&amp;lt;/procedure&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When trying to call the stored procedure, she got the following stacktrace:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>org.springframework.jdbc.UncategorizedSQLException: SqlMapClient operation;

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After hours of staring at the problem, and comparing code with similar constructions from other projects, we decided to switch to the Oracle 9i thin driver to see if that would solve the problem. It didn't, but there was an interesting development: The Oracle 9i driver actually gave us a decent error about not being able to parse the SQL statement. Which brings us to...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The solution:&lt;/strong>
We removed all layout from the procedure mapping, which resulted in:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;procedure id=&amp;quot;insertBar&amp;quot; parameterMap=&amp;quot;barbeanMap&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
{call store_bar (?,?)}
&amp;lt;/procedure&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This solved the problem. Then we switched back to the Oracle 10i thin driver, and the problem was still gone. The problem lies in the TAB between the left curly bracket and the word &amp;quot;call&amp;quot;. Oracle can not handle this.To investigate this problem, we then also tried to insert &lt;![CDATA[ ]]> around the procedure call, but as soon as there is a TAB between the { and the word &amp;quot;call&amp;quot; iBATIS will throw a NullPointer. The strange thing is that you can have spaces, newlines and tabs &lt;em>anywhere&lt;/em> in the procedure mapping, as long as there is no TAB between the left curly and the word &amp;quot;call&amp;quot;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It ain't what you do...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/11/02/it-aint-what-you-do/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2006 19:38:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/11/02/it-aint-what-you-do/</guid><description>
&lt;p>...it's the way that you do it. Last week I noticed a funny thing in an application I'm involved in as a developer. For logging in to the application, the term &amp;quot;Log On&amp;quot; was used. However, for logging off, &amp;quot;Log Out&amp;quot; was used. This did not feel right, so I searched a bit on the use of these terms. It looks like more people are having trouble choosing one form or the other, and are also mixing on/off and in/out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/log%20in">&lt;!-- more -->Log in&lt;/a> / Log out
This is the Unix variant for logging in and out a user. Note that &amp;quot;Log in&amp;quot; is two words. In modern dictionaries like the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, &amp;quot;log in&amp;quot; is written both as &amp;quot;log in&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;log-in&amp;quot;, with a hypen. &amp;quot;log in&amp;quot; is a synonym for the main entry, &amp;quot;log on&amp;quot;. Funny detail is that the dictionary has no entry for &amp;quot;log out&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/log%20on">Log on&lt;/a> / Log off
This is the Windows variant for logging in and out a user. As with &amp;quot;Log in&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Log on&amp;quot; is always written as two seperate words, optionaly concatinated with a hypen. Merriam also doesn't contain entries for &amp;quot;log off&amp;quot; or alike.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/sign%20in">Sign in&lt;/a> / &lt;a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/sign%20out">Sign out&lt;/a>
This is the Google (and several other websites) variant of &amp;quot;log in&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;log out&amp;quot;. It is arguably the best choice on earth for log in and out actions, because of the following reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. The term &amp;quot;log on&amp;quot; is often used to send people to a URL, without actually logging in. Example (as heard on TV): &amp;quot;Log on to www.nbc.com for more information.&amp;quot;. This use of the term &amp;quot;log on&amp;quot; confuses people as to what the term &amp;quot;log on&amp;quot; means.
2. The term &amp;quot;log in&amp;quot; suffers more or less from the same problem as &amp;quot;log on&amp;quot;. Like &amp;quot;log on&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;log in&amp;quot; has no counterpart in Merriam-Webster's dictionary.
3. The term &amp;quot;Sign in&amp;quot; is a clear association with physically entering a building, and in this case, a system.
4. &amp;quot;Sign in&amp;quot; has a clear counterpart in Merriam-Webster, &amp;quot;Sign out&amp;quot;, and is less likely to be intermixed with &amp;quot;log out/off&amp;quot;.
5. For some reason, everybody knows that &amp;quot;Sign in&amp;quot; is written as two seperate words.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Yes I know, it sounds like a lot of trouble for a seemingly little thing. But I like to be consequent when writing code, thereby hoping that other people can actually read, understand and maintain my code as I would like to be able to read, understand and maintain theirs. Programmers often spend (much) more time trying to understand other people's code than writing new code of their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To come back to the start of all this, I changed &amp;quot;Log in&amp;quot; to read &amp;quot;Log on&amp;quot;, so the application is now a Windows-like &amp;quot;Log on&amp;quot; / &amp;quot;Log off&amp;quot; application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tangerine BPM Analyzer</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/10/22/tangerine-bpm-analyzer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Oct 2006 19:51:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/10/22/tangerine-bpm-analyzer/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.potionfactory.com/blog/2006/10/18/introducing-tangerine/">Tangerine&lt;/a>, a BPM (Beats Per Minute) analyzer for use with iTunes on a mac. I downloaded it, and it works as advertised. It scans your iTunes music library, and analyzes the BPM (and intensity of the pattern) of each track. It does this in the background, and on my Mac mini Core duo I can continue wih my normal programs while Tangerine analyzes the tracks. The BPM values get saved to your iTunes library, so they will also show up in iTunes if you have the BPM column visible there. The &amp;quot;Intensity&amp;quot; will not be visible in your normal iTunes lists.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![Tangerine Screenshot](o_afbeelding-1.thumbnail.jpg)
&lt;p>](o_afbeelding-1.jpg)Tangerine presents itself with a very iTunes like feel, showing your iTunes playlists on the left, and a track listing will eat the larger part of the top right side. Directly beneath the playlist and track list there is a space in which you can build your playlist. This is a new way of presenting a playlist, which I think is a very welcome way of editting playlists for &lt;a href="http://www.nike.com/nikeplus/">Nike+&lt;/a> owners (which I am not by the way). It shows the tracks played in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological">chronological&lt;/a> order, with a timeline at the top (numbers displayed are minutes, see screenshot). This will enable you to plan your workout, since you will know when that 160 BPM track will hit your ears. The only suggestion I have to the evelopers is to put the BPM of the added track below the image, so you can see where the BPM's are going in the playlist. And the &amp;quot;180&amp;quot; I see displayed in the top left makes no sense to me, maybe this needs polishing in the 1.0 version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me as a programmer, this saves me a lot of time finding my &amp;quot;getting in the zone&amp;quot; tracks. It will also prove to be a good tool while creating your iDVD movies or slideshows, helping you find that uptempo track for your great surfing shots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some tracks Tangerine tends to miscalculate the BPM, resulting in values like &amp;quot;4&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;3491234&amp;quot; as BPM. Luckaly, the &amp;quot;intensity&amp;quot; value not only tells something about the contrast the bassdrum has with the rest of the music, but also on how sure Tangerine is about the accuracy of the BPMs. The higher the &amp;quot;intensity&amp;quot;, the more sure Tangerine is about it's BPM. Intensities of 60 and higher are pretty accurate most of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This release of Tangerine (0.9.2) is a free beta, so start downloading now! The next release will probably cost a few dollars, I don't expect it to eat your yearly income. As with most Apple software I expect it to sell for between 10 and 30 euro's.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Welcome www.rolfje.com readers!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/10/20/welcome-wwwrolfjecom-readers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Oct 2006 19:47:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/10/20/welcome-wwwrolfjecom-readers/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Because the update process of my old site was much more hassle than typing a post, I noticed that my blog was better maintained than my site. Therefore I have decided to redirect traffic to my domain (rolfje.com) to my blog. You can still find the original content of &lt;a href="http://www.rolfje.com">www.rolfje.com&lt;/a> at &lt;a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Errolfje/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->To be able to do this I had to strip the original content of the "link protection script" which would lead you to www.rolfje.com in case somebody framed my site in his site. I discovered I could do this without even uploading the whole site again (I can't figure out how to get my homebrew perl synchronization script working again). I wrote the following short script called "fixlinks.sh" and placed in my home dir on the server:
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;
#!/bin/sh
sed -e 's@window.location = &amp;quot;http://www.rolfje.com/&amp;quot;;
... @/* window.location = &amp;quot;http://www.rolfje.com/&amp;quot;; */@'
... $1 &amp;gt; $1.new
mv $1.new $1
echo processed $1
&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>(the &amp;quot;...&amp;quot; indicating a wrapped line here) and then issued the following command from the WWW directory:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;
find . -name &amp;quot;*.htm?&amp;quot; -type f -exec ~/fixlinks.sh {} \;
&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From now on, the pages no longer care where they're linked from. The content is pretty outdated and only interesting for racers still having a Proceed, so I guess that the whole issue of people framing my site to make believe they have the &amp;quot;scoops&amp;quot; is no longer a problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enjoy the new content and/or setup. If you can't find what you're looking for, give a shout, I can include another radio button in the search on my site to include the original &lt;a href="http://www.rolfje.com">www.rolfje.com&lt;/a> content.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Monique Pels</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/10/04/monique-pels/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Oct 2006 19:48:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/10/04/monique-pels/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Okay, I found the answer to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2006/09/25/samba-shares-and-usb-drives/">my problem&lt;/a>. Mounting an USB drive on OSX which is formatted as Fat32, will not behave nicely when being accessed through samba. Trying to start multiple copy processes simultaniously will cause seemingly random &amp;quot;file locked&amp;quot; errors. I just formatted the drive as HFS+, and the problem dissapeared. This is a screenshot you'd expect when copying, but I was very happy to see it just a minute ago:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_afbeelding-2.gif" alt="Multiple file copyÂ jobs">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I've cleared that problem, I can start working on the backup and virusscanning processes, and writing a nice &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; so you can do the same with your mac mini!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I should have done this right away like I planned. HFS+ is far better than Fat32 (journalled, auto-defragmenting, case preserving, and better in preserving file integrity).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Samba shares and USB drives</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/09/25/samba-shares-and-usb-drives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2006 14:54:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/09/25/samba-shares-and-usb-drives/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I am very close to migrating the data on my bulky PC to my new Mac Mini fileserver and mounting the IDE drives in the USB drive brackets. Once I've done this, I will have the screenshots and data to write a nice &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; on using the Mac Mini as a file server. There is however one slight problem which could prove to be a showstopper...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Samba test 1: local directories.&lt;/strong>
I created a directory in the root of the HD in the mac mini, and made it R/W for everybody. Then, I used SharePoints to make it available to all password-less Guest users on the network (which happens to be the default Windows user for connecting to drives without asking for a password). All was well. I could access the share, and could copy as many files from as many machines imultaniously as I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Samba test 2: USB mounted volumes.&lt;/strong>
I mounted a HFS+ formatted USB disk to the Mac Mini, and made it available to the network in the same way as in test 1. Everything seemed to be working fine and as expected, but while running some tests I discovered a strange thing: I can only copy files onto the USB drive from 1 machine at a time, 1 file at a time. When starting a new copy while allready in the process of copying an older file, one or both copy jobs crashed with a &amp;quot;file in use&amp;quot; error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am now trying to find out what is causing this problem. I have a firewire drive I can use to determine if it is the USB protocol or driver which is causing this problem, or if it is the fact that it is a mounted volume alltogether. If anybody has tips I'm glad to hear them. Meanwhile I'll be searching the web...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>
Using a firewire drive does not solve the problem. I did find some articles on fast user switching which state that only 1 user can access pheripherals at a time. This seems to be related to this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2&lt;/strong>
Creating a symlink to the mounted volume and sharing the link through samba will not change behaviour. I was expecting this, but tried anyway because it only costs 1 minute to test. Maybe a virtual drive would be an option. I can create virtual RAID disks in OSX, but I don't want my setup to be complex. This will add to the complexity when recovering from a sever crash. Simple, full and fast recovery from hardware problems is my top priority.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tryout Mac Mini as Fileserver</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/09/20/tryout-mac-mini-as-fileserver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2006 14:51:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/09/20/tryout-mac-mini-as-fileserver/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The past 5 years (or more, I can't remember exactly) I have had a windows server which provided 4 &amp;quot;shares&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;network disks&amp;quot; to the users of my local network. Simplicity was it's power. All network users would connect with the default windows &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot; account to prevent complicated logon screens and forgetting of passwords. To prevent damage to files, all shares are read-only, except for one, where people can drop files. Only the administrator of the machine can move the files from the drop box into the different read-only shares. All files on the server were backed up twice a week to a different (physical) drive, and all drives were automatically virusscanned each day and on-access, and defragmented once a week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My dad is also using this server (we have a wifi bridge between our homes and yes, it is military grade encrypted). A few weeks ago we ran out of diskspace (bought new cameras :-). So we bought a 320GB drive. The old server with the passivly cooled 600MHz pentium 1 processor decided it didn't like the large drive so we had to upgrade the hardware. I built a new server from my old desktop PC, which was collecting dust because I am now a happy Mac user. When the new server was ready, it was much more noisy than the old one (more fans), and slurped 105 Watts while doing nothing, and up to 140 Watts under booting or serious disk/network access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just for fun, we also measured the power usage of my Mac Mini. It was using 40 Watt under heavy disk access, and only 20Watts when doing practically nothing. In sleep mode this even dropped to 3 Watts! This, plus the fact that the PC was producing so much heat that we actually started to worry about it catching on fire when placed inside a closet, convinced my dad to use a Mac Mini as a file server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, he called me to tell me he had bought a G4 Mac Mini to be used as a fileserver for around 300 Euros. I picked it up and re-installed OSX on it. This only took 30 minutes or so, and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by the performance of the G4 in comparison with my Core duo Mac Mini with 2GB memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tonight, I installed &lt;a href="http://hornware.com/sharepoints/">Sharepoints&lt;/a> on it, which is a utility to efectively edit the smb.conf file on your mac. I hooked up an USB disk, and got it running as a samba share in less than 5 minutes, complete with Windows Guest login. Just now, I also managed to make one of the 2 shares readonly, which prooves that the mac Mini can behave itself exectly as the PC server I had to the outside world. This would be great, if I give it the same network name nobody will even notice that their files are now served by a Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to mimic my fileserver completely soon (somewhere next week) and will post a complete description of what the original server did, and what I did to get the Mac Mini to replicate that behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now go buy your own Mac Mini G4 and some USB (or better: firewire) harddrives (with spindown capability!) and join me next week in building your mac Mini fileserver. Have a proper place and a proper backup for your files and photos!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon, your house will be free of PC's... :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>"I have not actually read this book"</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/09/04/i-have-not-actually-read-this-book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Sep 2006 14:48:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/09/04/i-have-not-actually-read-this-book/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Do you still want &amp;quot;that last lens and that's it&amp;quot;? According to the statistics on &lt;a href="http://medfmt.8k.com/bronlensenvy.html">this page&lt;/a>, you probably already have the right lens in your camera bag. Chances are that you are using your cheapest lens most often. The best quote from this page must be &lt;strong>&amp;quot;The cost of the lens is inversely proportional to the frequency of its use.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where did I get that link from? Well, from a brilliant text by Ken Rockwel titled &lt;a href="http://kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamera.htm">&amp;quot;Your Camera Does Not Matter&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. It states that you may not only have overspent on lenses, but on your complete kit alltogether! According to Ken, &lt;strong>&amp;quot;Buying new gear will NOT improve your photography.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

Next time you see a guy with a D200, don't be impressed. The guy behind him with his old &lt;a href="http://www.apogeephoto.com/july2001/plastic_fantastic.shtml">Holga&lt;/a> camera could be shooting far better pictures!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have had a &lt;a href="http://www.photo.net/ezshop/product?product_id=280">Canon EOS 300 (35mm film)&lt;/a>, a &lt;a href="http://www.pbase.com/cameras/canon/powershot_a20">Canon Powershot A20&lt;/a> and now a &lt;a href="http://www.pbase.com/cameras/canon/eos_350d">Canon 350D&lt;/a>. I also have made photo's with some of my dad's camera's, a &lt;a href="http://www.pbase.com/cameras/canon/ft_ql">Canon FT-QL&lt;/a>, and an &lt;a href="http://www.classiccamera.com.pl/exa2b.html">Exa IIB&lt;/a>. When changing from one camera to another, my photography (in particular composition) did not change. It just took some trouble away from the process. EOS 200 to Canon A20: no more film hassle. Canon A20 to 350D: Faster bootup and shot-to-shot times. Canon FT-QL and Exa IIB: The romantic feeling of craftsmanship when holding the camera :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="t_img_0223.jpg" alt="Hedge sparrow on a fence, at 200mm, apertureÂ 5.6">
Sure the 350D gives me nice resolution and more freedom to play with aperture and exposure times and I still like the camera after reading Kens article. But he is right. Period. I recently spoke to a guy who owned an EOS 300 just like I did. He looked at one of my photo's from the 350D and said &amp;quot;I've got to have that camera, how did you do that?&amp;quot;. I explained &amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot; to him and told him that he could do that with his own EOS 300 if he had taken the time to learn how to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I guess some sales people translate &amp;quot;I want a good camera&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;I want to spend a truckload of cash on a camera of which I'll only use the full-auto mode to shoot pictures of uncle Zed with.&amp;quot; People who don't know what &amp;quot;aperture&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;exposure time&amp;quot; means just want a snapshot camera which automatically will produce clear, colorful, crisp foto's of uncle Zed 95% of the time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before buying a camera, read Ken's article, get out of that chair and start shooting with whatever camera you have right now. That one brilliant moment is waiting for you!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EyeTV Export, done right</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/08/23/eyetv-export-done-right/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2006 15:03:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/08/23/eyetv-export-done-right/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A while ago, I bought a &lt;a href="http://www.miglia.com/products/video/tvmax/index.html">Miglia TV max&lt;/a> for my Mac Mini. With it, you get &lt;a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=support_updates_eyetv2">EyeTV&lt;/a>, the PVR recording software. I was very happy using it, but I recently discovered that all exported MPG files are missing the last part. Arg!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a VERY serious bug. It also means that each and every recording I have archived on my external HD is crippled, so I can start all over with collecting series. Lucky as I am, each and every serie gets rerun after rerun on Dutch TV. They have many channels to fill, much commercials to sell and very little (interesting) new material to show.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Since the endings weren't missing from the recordings as long as they were still part of EyeTV's library, I did a little bit of investigating. As it turns out, the original MPG recording can very easily be copied from the eyeTV archive. This saves you a (very) lengthy export process, and leaves you with a perfect MPG2 file. And yes, your edits are in there to, so no commercials!
&lt;p>What you need to do, is go to your &amp;quot;Documents&amp;quot; folder, and open the &amp;quot;EyeTV Archive&amp;quot; folder. Select a recording you wish to export (*.eyetv), and hold the &amp;quot;Ctrl&amp;quot; key while clicking it. Select &amp;quot;Show Contents&amp;quot; from the menu:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_afbeelding-6.gif" alt="Opening the package">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you have done that, you will see the mpg file in it's full glory, although with a wierd number as a filename:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_afbeelding-3-copy.gif" alt="Package contents">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now just copy the mpg file to any location you like. The only downside is that you need to rename it manually. The upside is that this is the mpg as you left it after editting, in the same resolution, and it doesn't take ages to convert it to some stupid mp4 or mov file nobody supports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view the mpg file you need an expensive quicktime version, or you can just view it with &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayerosx/">MPlayer OSX&lt;/a>, which will happily play MPG2 encoded files for you, without nagging about payments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now maybe if I can get my head around Folder Actions and Automator, I might just be able to create a folder which gets the mpg from an eyetv recording and automatically renames it. Suggestions anyone?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>request a password at the command-line without display</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/08/18/request-a-password-at-the-command-line-without-display/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2006 15:07:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/08/18/request-a-password-at-the-command-line-without-display/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Trying to view his Steveness in the Apple WWDC 2006 Keynote addres? Me too, and haven't been lucky for 3 days in a row. I actually managed to view 3 minutes of distorted, half-audio presentation, but then it died, and has given me an error 400 ever since. It's not nice to see Apple not being able to cope with the demand. A bittorrent would be nice I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my first edit of this post I thought I'd found a mirror, but it was an old keynote. Searching on, I found a terrific tip which solved the problem of not being able to view the keynote. It actually turns out it's the default Quicktime settings are causing the problems. Quicktime fetches the stream over UDP, which makes no guarantee over lost packets. You can set Quicktime to fetch the stream through http, which has a few advantages, such as losless transfer of data, and ability for proxy server to cache data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To set Quicktime to fetch the video accros http:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Go to System Preferences
* Open Quicktime preferences from the system preferences screen
* Click on the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; tab
* Choose &amp;quot;Custom&amp;quot; for transport setup
* In the window that pops up, choose the HTTP transport protocol
* Close the system preferences
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now go to the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/aug_2006/event/index.html">WWDC 2006 Keynote address page&lt;/a> and view the video. I just did, it worked fine, no dropped frames or audio.
Enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. Tiger shipped for 80 euro's when it was released. If Leopard is anywhere close to that same price, it will be hard to find an operating system which gives you all this, with this quality, for this price. Professional grade OS, for the price of a SuSe distribution! I love Tiger, I know I'm going to love Leopard. Since I have my Mac, my Windows laptop (which was an expensive one I might add) is sitting in a corner of my desk, covered under a layer of dust. It's simply not good enough anymore.

&lt;p>We zijn al redelijk ver in Nederland met de regelgeving. Steeds meer regeltjes die dingen regelen waarvan je zou kunnen bedenken dat als je normaal gezond verstand hebt, dat zelf ook kunt bedenken. Gordels om bijvoorbeeld. Als je dat niet doet, wie heb je er dan mee? Jezelf! Moet de regering nou echt gezonde, volwassen mensen tegen zichzelf beschermen? Ik zeg: natuurlijke selectie toepassen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Het word natuurlijk wat anders als het gaat om situaties waarbij mensen iemand anders in gevaar brengen. Hard rijden op een motor? Prima, op een lege snelweg. Hardrijden op een motor door een woonwijk? Rijbewijs en motor kwijt. Korte metten. Het probleem is niet het apparaat, maar de bestuurder. Kijk, net zoals die leuke minibikes. Als je daar verstandig mee omgaat, zie ik het probleem er niet van. Maarja, de Nederlandse regering zou de regering niet zijn als ze er niet &lt;a href="http://www.nos.nl/nos/artikelen/2006/08/art000001C6B7A3D578E714.html">iets aan doen&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Zelf heb ik zo'n leuke electrische step gekocht een jaar of wat geleden. Als ik er op rijd, word ik lachend ingehaald door kleine kinderen op kleine stepjes. Toch vind de regering dat ik het ding zou moeten &amp;quot;goedkeuren voor de openbare weg&amp;quot; en &amp;quot;verzekeren&amp;quot; en het liefst zien ze vast ook nog dat ik een helm, scheenbeschermers, gebruik. Naast de airbags die op de scooter moeten zitten natuurlijk. Tegelijkertijd kun je met een normaal auto-rijbewijs zonder helm de snelweg opduiken met een trike of quad. Dan moet de quad wel gordels hebben. Lekker nuttig. Over krom gesproken.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When you are using a (digital) camera and need to place it on an uneven surface to keep it still long enough for your long shutter speeds, or you want to make a shot on the release timer (or both), you'll need a tripod, or a &lt;a href="http://www.shortcourses.com/equipment/tripods/beanbag.jpg">beanbag&lt;/a>. A beanbag is an ideal option, you can tuck it into your backpack, take it everywhere you need and it fits all camera's.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure, you can buy a beanbag from a nice company like &lt;a href="http://www.wildlifewatchingsupplies.co.uk/">this&lt;/a>, and spend about 30 euro's or more. But, If you've got a needle, thread, a T-shirt or linnen bag, and some rice, you can make one for free!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->![Beanbag materials](o_img_8641.jpg)
&lt;p>Start by sacrificing your linnen bag or t-shirt, cutting out two square pieces of about 23x23cm (or larger if you want to support a larger camera/lens combination). As you can see here, I saved me some sewing because I used the corner of a linnen bag. Now I only had to stich up 2 sides of the &amp;quot;pillow&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Put the two pieces on top of eachother and sew them together. Don't worry about being close to the edges, leave plenty of room there, because you will turn it inside-out later on. To be able to turn it inside-out and fill it with rice (or other forms of &amp;quot;beads&amp;quot;), leave about 7cm on one edge un-sewed. I also recommend to leave the hole in the middle of an edge. This way you'll have 4 nice sharp corners on the bag lateron.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turn the bag inside out. Now the edges look nicer, don't they? Roll up a piece of A4 paper and put it in the hole of your bag, and make it into a funnel. Poor the beads (rice, dries peas or beans, or fatboy filling) into the funnel. Make sure you don't fill the bag totally, because then it will not be flexible enough. I used about 1kg of rice for mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_img_8647.jpg" alt="Beanbag finished">
Close the bag by sewing the last opening. This takes some attention, this is the part of your sewing which could be visible. You can see where I closed the bag at the bottom right of the picture with the Powershot on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beanbag I made supports my Canon EOS 350D perfectly. There are a few improvements on my list after making it. My next beanbag will:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * be made of a black t-shirt so it's less reflecting
* be filled with [fatboy filling](http://www.serenityhealth.com/bean_filler.html) to prevent problems when getting the bag wet (rice stinks :-)
* be slightly bigger
* will contain a zipper or velcro on the opening so I can (re)fill it
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now make one of your own and go and use the 30 euro's you just saved to buy nice UV lens filters. :-)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>To every photo-editing, image-manipulating, red-eye-reducing software developer on the planet: Sharpening photographs by default is NOT a good idea! If images aren't sharp directly from the camera, there was something wrong with them to begin with. Most camera's nowadays make fine pictures which don't need sharpening.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Reason for this post is that just a few minutes ago, I was wondering why my new (and expensive) Canon 350D still showed noise in blue skies, even at 100 ISO. It turned out not to be noise. It was [Lightroom](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/lightroom/) (the public Beta application for OSX) tries to "Sharpen" and "Smooth" the images by default, and not by a small amount, I might add. So the little dust particles which were perfectly captured by my excelent camera with that excelent lens, were (cough) "enhanced", after which the very nice flat-blue sky turned in to a freckle disaster. I also heard that [Rawshooter](http://www.pixmantec.com/products/rawshooter.asp) does the exact same thing. It's really a shame, because a good lens, a good camera, some experience and a little effort should produce sharp photo's to begin with.
&lt;p>Sure I like the &amp;quot;digital darkroom&amp;quot; idea of being able to do some post-processing of photographs, but I am convinced of the fact that you should have quality material to begin with (meaning a good photo). I think that for every minute you spend trying to make a great shot with the camera in your hand, you save 15 minutes trying to correct mistakes with a mouse in your hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, I am not a star photographer. Yes, I need to tweak some photo's to get the effect I was looking for with the camera. Yes, I am trying to learn to do it directly with aperture and shutter speed, and yes, that takes a lot of time and effort because no, I'm not a natural :-) . Just venting some furstrations here. Sorry.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Google Blogoscoped Monitor Chain</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/07/17/google-blogoscoped-monitor-chain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2006 15:17:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/07/17/google-blogoscoped-monitor-chain/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Please photograph this blog post (including your monitor and its immediate surroundings), and post the resulting pic on your blog. Then the next person photographs your blog post and posts it, and so on. Leave your post URL in the comments of the blog you photographed so people will be able to follow the chain back up (zoom out), and link your image to the post you photographed... this way people will be able to zoom into the monitors by clicking.

&lt;p>I really like iTunes. When you have 1 computer (an apple, that is ;-), and 1 place to store your music, it's all you'll ever need. It is easy to manage your music with, it puts your files in reasonably understandably locations (artist/album/track), has nice smart playlists and there are a lot of plugins available.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I also like to store my precious media at a different machine than my desktop. Since a desktop is more prone to "crashes", nearly allways caused by user error, it is not the place to keep your important or irreplacable files, like your family photo's. So I have a network. On this network, I have a server which contains my digital media (foto's and mp3's, mainly). The server is only used as storage location, does not run strange software, automatically backs up all files to a seperate harddisk, defragments drives and mails me when something goes wrong. Access to shares is restricted properly, guests can only read files, and there is one "incomming" share where people can read and write. Important files get moved to the read-only shares by an administrator user (me). This server has been up and running for over 4 years now, without a hickup, and with backups of at most 2 days old.
&lt;p>Being all organized, my iTunes library is also on this server. As long as I use 1 computer, with 1 instance of iTunes, all is well. But when I start up a different computer (the one in the living room) to listen to my music, things get ugly. The iTunes library is really designed to be managed by 1 iTunes instance. Changes made to my music library on one computer, can not be seen on the other. Even worse: it handles it terribly (music not found, warning messages all over, etc.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One solution would be to leave the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; iTunes computer running and share the library. Then I can connect to that share in the living room. But when I do this, I have 3 computers eating electricity, and the added trouble of not being able to put files on my mp3 player from the living room machine. And there I am, thinking that my music was mine. Apperently not, iTunes decides to &amp;quot;protect&amp;quot; the music from being listened to by it's rightful owner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and again, I turn to Google to see if anybody has found a cure for this problem. But all Google comes up with, is more people having the same problem, hopelessly crude and complex rsync procedures, or way inferior music player alternatives. Today, I stubled upon &lt;a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/home">Songbird&lt;/a>, a multi platform music player looking like iTunes. I haven't tried it out yet (I'm not that bold), it's version 0.2, and according to the makers merely a preview of what's to come. So not something I'll be managing my music library with for some time, but I'll be watching that space, because it sure looks like these guys pay attention to what they're doing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm hoping to see a way to access my music from more than 1 computer in the near future, be it iTunes or SongBird. And I think many more people are hoping this to!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>gmail down for days</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/07/09/gmail-down-for-days/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2006 15:28:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/07/09/gmail-down-for-days/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Great, gmail is down for days now. I really hope it will return soon, so I can back up that mail to my server. By going down, Google showed me how much I came to rely on them, while they're actually unreachable when something happens, and I don't even have backups of my own mails! I really like gmail and the way it organizes your mail by -ehrm- not organizing it (when it's up, that is).&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Problem with these free online services (gmail, hotmail, yahoo mail...) is that because you do not pay for them, you can't hold them responsible for anything basically. Sure, they have a moral duty to be online because you trust them with your mail, and they can't violate that trust. But still, you don't pay them, and they probably have had lawyers carefully craft the license agreement so that you can't sue them when they go down or -shudder- loose your data.
&lt;p>So, when you're using gmail, make sure you also set up a machine at home to backup your account through POP. I know I'll be doing that when it comes back up. I also tell people to send mail to my email alias. Most people don't even know my gmail address. Another good measure for being able to switch mail providers without having to tell everybody. So... watch it google, you may loose a freeloading customer here! (you can stop giggling now, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#larry">Larry&lt;/a>, and you too, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/corporate/execs.html#sergey">Sergey&lt;/a>)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Want Security?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/07/05/want-security/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2006 15:31:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/07/05/want-security/</guid><description>
&lt;p>According to Sophos security, the whole world should &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5150508.stm">switch to macs to get rid of the security problems&lt;/a>. This would be great for business! Currently I do not order with companies who put up Word or Excel formatted price lists, simply because I can't (and to some extent refuse) open them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the long run however, this would shift the security problem to the Mac side of the world. Why do Microsoft machines get attacked so often? Simple: because their user base is large, which means there are more Microsoft (black hat) hackers out there. Additionally, the targeted audience is large in numbers. When the whole world uses Macs, the black hat hackers will turn to OSX as target.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then again, the security model of OSX is (luckaly) a lot better than that of a Windows machine so the damage done largely depends on how the system is secured by the user. At least on a Mac you have the means of securing stuff properly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MP3 Gain for OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/06/21/mp3-gain-for-osx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2006 15:44:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/06/21/mp3-gain-for-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>So here I am using iTunes on my Apple. So far so good. The downside is that I have an iBead as an mp3 player, so there are a few problems with that. First of all, iTunes only plays nice with the iPods (and a few other oddballs ;-). For me to put mp3's on my iBead, I can drag them over from iTunes onto the USB drive, but when things' don't fit, it just doesn't copy at all. Also, automatic random playlists aren't that automatic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, I can live with all these little problems. I can create a playlist limited to a particular size, empty my iBead and drag the mp3's over. But when I play them on my iBead, the volume levels are far apart. In the old days I used mp3Gain on my PC to level out all volumes, which worked great. But iTunes has it's own take on that: It stores a relative volume in the file, and iPods know how to handle this properly, adjusting the volume. My iBead however, doesn't.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tonight I went out to look for a tool which could adjust the volumes of my mp3's on my Mac mini. And guess what? I found it! &lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/AudioTron/MacMP3Gain/">MacMP3Gain&lt;/a> does it all, and it is currently processing my complete library, adjusting all volumes. It has a &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; option so it won't hog all processing power. I think it will be finished somewhere tommorow afternoon. It claims to be lossless, so I guess I can run it on my complete library every once in a while without having to worry about which files are new or not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photo Statistics</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/06/21/photo-statistics/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2006 15:32:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/06/21/photo-statistics/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I am trying to decide what lens to buy for my Canon EOS 350D. The first descision to make is what focal length I need. To do this, I found a nice tool which can display statistical info about your photographs. It shows you how many foto's you've made at certain focal lengths, with which aperture, ISO, metering, and other EXIF fields. It's a windows only tool, and it's called &lt;a href="http://www.softsymphony.com/photostat_descr.htm">Smart Photo Statistics&lt;/a>. It's absolutely 100% free software and works as expected. It can even copy the graphs to the clipboard for you to use elsewhere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm gathering statistics right now on all photo's of all digital camera's I've owned, to see what focal lentgths I need. Great tool!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Canon 350D B/W Sepia</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/06/03/canon-350d-bw-sepia/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jun 2006 15:44:52 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/06/03/canon-350d-bw-sepia/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Once in a while I like to take black and white pictures because the EOS has a nice built in set of color filters. The easiest example of a nice black and white photo where a color filter produces great results is the classic &amp;quot;blue sky with Yellow filter&amp;quot;. You should really check out the great tutorials on &lt;a href="http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials.htm">Cambridge in Color&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="r_canon-color.jpg" alt="350DÂ Sepia">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When shooting in B/W mode, I often use the &amp;quot;sepia&amp;quot; filter, to add a little warmth to the photo. A wierd thing I noticed lately about the EOS 350D (besides the film transport sound) is that &amp;quot;Sepia&amp;quot; mode is not really producing pure B/W Sepia images. There is color seeping through! In the top image, you can clearly see residues of red, yellow and blue in a photo of a baby toy (cropped for privacy reasons). The bottom image is converted to pure B/W on a computer and then sort of &amp;quot;Sepia&amp;quot;-d using a hue/saturation tool just for reference.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read on some forums that camera effects are generally not as good as the effects in image processing programs like PhotoShop or GIMP. This is supposedly because speed/quality tradeoffs. I really like to spend more time with the camera than post-processing, so I'd like to keep using the in-camera effects. A great tip I read somewhere on a forum is to shoot in RAW+JPG mode. The JPG will have all the processing done by the camera, and the RAW will be the raw data from the sensor. Depending on the results of the in-camera effects, you either keep the JPG, or use the RAW image to do the effect in GIMP later on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding double entries in iTunes</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/23/finding-double-entries-in-itunes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2006 16:03:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/23/finding-double-entries-in-itunes/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The Mac has been on for the past few days, even with the Maxtor FAT32 250GB drive connected, without problems. I hope it doesn't break down again, because I'd have to bring it to a different Mac store and explain the whole thing again... Anyway, I was playing with iTunes and found a simple trick to find double entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open a Terminal, go to the root of your iTunes music collection folder and type
find . -name &amp;quot;*1.mp3&amp;quot; -type f&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will give you a list of all tracks ending with &amp;quot;1.mp3&amp;quot;, which is how iTunes renames double-entries. Do not look at the filenames, but rather select the artist in iTunes with the double tracks, and use the &amp;quot;show double entries&amp;quot; in iTunes to do the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn't much, but it saves you the trouble of finding double tracks in your 8 zillion tracks ;-) .
Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mac Drama Day</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/20/mac-drama-day/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2006 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/20/mac-drama-day/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="t_img_6298.jpg" alt="Mac Support guy on the job inÂ Uitgeest">
So, finally the first post on my blog since 2 weeks of Mac absence. I really got annoyed by the repair guys at Mac support the past few days. I started calling them daily, and discovered if you don't, your repair just simply will sit there on a shelf. For some strange reason, they ordered a superdrive for my Mini, the guy on the phone promised me he would install it on friday as soon as he got it. So I called in friday afternoon to see how things are going, and guess what? The drive was in, but not in my Mac! They promised me they would install it and call back. You guessed it: they didn't.This mornig I decided to drive over there, because they essentially promised it would be ready yesterday. Although nobody called me, apperantly the repair was done, and I could take it home. On the receipt it said &amp;quot;superdrive and memory swapped, hardware test, everything ok&amp;quot;. So I took it home, connected it and booted it in single-user mode. Since my trust in these guys had dropped to an all-time low, I decided to run at least 3 full memtests. At the very first run, it failed, with the &lt;strong>exact same error as two weeks ago&lt;/strong>. I was furious! Not only did they take 2 weeks to swap out a non-faulty superdrive, they didn't swap the memory, although they lied on the receipt about having done so!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I put it back in the box, to spend another half hour driving to Uitgeest. I demanded that the mini was repaired while I was waiting. Suddenly, there were tech-guys available, although they claim to do no repairs on saturday. Wierd. I spent an hour waiting, and a young kid comes to ask me for my &lt;strong>password&lt;/strong>, can you beleive that? You can't do that! Besides, they just spent 2 weeks repairing it without ever needing my password, and now they do? I explained to him that he didn't need my password to run memtest, and that I wasn't planning on giving it to him. Back to the repair desk he went.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind me in line there was a lady who wanted to pick up her &amp;quot;repaired&amp;quot; ipod (they don't repair those, they just keep yours in for 2 weeks and then give you a new one). The tech guy said that nobody called her, and she replied (insulted) that she did speak to one of the guys and he was very clear on the phone about the ipod being ready to be picked up. After 20 minutes of walking around and talking to eachother the techguys &amp;quot;suddenly&amp;quot; found the ipod, and gave it to her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my waiting I constantly noticed how other people were also treated like I had been treated: Polite, but slow, and constanly making excuses about the slow cash register, the stupid network, how a collegue forgot to to this-and-that in the system, etc. etc. But it &lt;em>always&lt;/em> resulted in a long wait for the customer. It is clear to me that the macsupport store has to do something about both their technical and people skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally my Mac arrived, and the guy said he swapped the memory modules. I said that those were allready swapped. He denied, and I showed him the receipt. He mumbled something about a faulty batch of memory modules, and shoved the box in my direction, making it clear that he did not know what to do with that information. I asked if I could test the Mac, because I didn't feel like going home only to discover the problem was still not solved. He said he couldn't do that. I asked him to run memtest for me. He said he wasn't allowed to run non-apple approved software. He refused to get his boss when I asked him to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I walked to reception, and asked for the manager. The manager had left, but I talked to his backup about this problem. She also couldn't do much, as there was a music event going on in the store, and it was crowded. I explained to her that if I got home to find out the Mac was still defective, I would call the show owner on monday. She politely answered my questions, wrote down my name and off I went again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At home, I booted the mac in single user mode (again) and ran memtest (again). While it ran, I noticed that the last receipt I just got, describing the memory module swap, looked funny. I had been given more expensive memory modules... huh? And on the first repair note, there was only a typed remark &amp;quot;swapped memory&amp;quot;. Strange. Memtest completed 3 runs without errors, as expected. It is now 17:08, and I have been driving back and forth between my home and the shop, and waiting at the shop since 10:15 this morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My conclusion is that they started the HW test, and it crashed while doing the superdrive diagnostics. The crash was not actually caused by the superdrive, but by the software hitting the memory softspot. They swapped out the superdrive and wrote a silly comment about the memory to keep me happy, while actually never touching those modules. That's why I got the exact same error this morning. When they actually did swap the memory modules this afternoon (like I asked them to do 2 weeks ago) the problem was gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought a Mac because I was tired of my PC crashing, but the pas two weeks I have experienced something worse: repair people who are polite but slow, refuse to listen, understand and do what you ask them to, don't return your calls, and give you your hardware back -- unrepaired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope I don't have to bring in more Apple stuff for repairs anytime soon...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mac Support... is... slooowww</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/16/mac-support-is-slooowww/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2006 15:59:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/16/mac-support-is-slooowww/</guid><description>
&lt;p>As you've probably read, my brand new Mac Mini has a memory problem. I have brought it in for repair, but I am &amp;quot;slightly irritated&amp;quot; by the speed at which the guys from the &lt;a href="http://www.macsupport.nl/home.php">www.macsupport.nl&lt;/a> stores pick things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Friday, May 6th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >I've found out that the mini has a consistent, reproducable memory problem. I suspect a technician could even tell which of the two memory modules it is judging from the faulty address (faulty single bit even, for the technical readers amongst us). It's late in the evening so I have to wait for the next day to call. I printed out a screenshot of the memory error and location, and put that in the box with the mini, to make sure they have a clear problem description.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Saturday, May 7th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Started calling the shop. They state that the tech support guys are not in on saturday. Strange, since they installed the memory modules on a saturday when I bought the thing. Can't the same guy swap out both modules so I have my machine back? Finding out which module is faulty can be done in the shop without me waiting. No apperantly not. I tried to call 3 of their shops, of which Amsterdam didn't even return my call even though I asked the operator to tell them to call me back.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Sunday, May 8th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Although the shop in Amsterdam claims to be open, they are to busy to pick up the phone.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Monday, May 9th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >I tried to call the new shop in Haarlem, but I get a "Sorry all lines are busy" message all day. At the end of the day I decide to drive to the shop. The shop is open, but they have network and phone problems (thanks to KPN, they claim). Because it is a new shop eveybody is uncertain as to what to do, and it takes me 45 minutes (!) to get the Mac mini to be taken in for repairs, even though I was helped the moment I entered the shop. They warn me that the repair is going to take a week (!).
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Tuesday, May 16th
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Still no call from the shop in Haarlem. When I try to call, I notice they still have the same phone line problems. So, I drive to the shop again to find out how the repairs are going. They in form me that my Mac is "scheduled for repair on the 19th"!. So it has been sitting there for almost 2 WEEKS! And then they haven't even begun to look at the problem. They expect it to be repaired and ready to be picked up at Monday, May 22nd at the earliest.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
As you can read, this is not a happy start of my 1600+ euro Apple adventure. I really hope they can get their logistics and repair process in shape. I really like the Mac mini, but I sure don't like the way Mac support takes their time to switch to memory modules and run a diagnostics tool.</description></item><item><title>Mac Mini Crash: Maxtor not the problem</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/06/mac-mini-crash-maxtor-not-the-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2006 15:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/06/mac-mini-crash-maxtor-not-the-problem/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="r_img_4139-cutout.jpg" alt="Memtest">
In my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2006/05/04/mac-mini-crash-cause-located/">last post&lt;/a>, the Maxtor OneTouch drive was the prime suspect of the spontanious crashing of the Mac. Tonight the Mac mini crashed again, but this time without the Maxtor connected to it. So I set out to do a thourough memory test in single user mode, running &lt;a href="http://www.memtestosx.org/">memtest&lt;/a>. And after a few iterations it was there: The dreaded memory failure. I guess I have to bring my mini back to the store to get replacement memory.Intermitting problems like this are terrible. They are hard to find, and you loose all trust in your computer, saving every 3 seconds, hoping you don't loose anything. If the external drive was really to blame, I would seriously have doubted the implementation of the USB drivers, because the system crashes without warning, without logging or anything. A memory failure was actually the more plausible casue all the time, since the kernel just stops because the processor(s) reach a part of the memory where there was supposed to be code, but has become garbage. To be able to log, the processor has to execute code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mac Mini Crash: cause located</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/04/mac-mini-crash-cause-located/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2006 15:54:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/04/mac-mini-crash-cause-located/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_maxtorfs.gif" alt="Windows screenshot showing Maxtor driveÂ stats">
Today I spent some more time using Google to find information on why my Mac suddenly crashed. I am now 99% that the cause of this all is my &lt;a href="http://www.nextag.com/Maxtor-ONE-TOUCH-II--zz68645598zB2z2--COMPARE-PRICES-html">Maxtor OneTouch 250GB&lt;/a> drive, which was formatted as one big Fat32 partition (screenshot). Although I connected it to a friend's iMac for a short period without problems, and it has worked on my Mac mini for a while, I keep finding discussions about people with &lt;a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/readflat.asp?forum=1017&amp;amp;message=16514032&amp;amp;changemode=1">crashed Macs&lt;/a>. I have not installed the Maxtor software, so that's &lt;a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tiger10.html">not the problem&lt;/a>.I have disconnected the Maxtor drive last Saturday, and my Mac has been up and running ever since, without problems. I can almost rule out memory related issues, because when I startup Eclipse while running &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd/">iDVD&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/archive/2006/04/23/88885.aspx">Clutter&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler&lt;/a> (yes all at the same time), the system keeps on running. In fact, it is still responding to user input as if I had only one of those programs running. Only very minimal swapping with 2GB memory, and when swapping, OS X is very efficient about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, my plans are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Only connect the maxtor to a PC while it is still Fat32.
2. Share the drive on the PC, and try to empty it as much as possible (move data to Mac and the fileserver)
3. Run [Rember](http://www.kelleycomputing.net:16080/rember/) in single user mode for a few iterations this weekend to rule out memory problems.
4. Decide on a filesystem to use on the Maxtor, and reformat it.
5. Re-connect the Maxtor OneTouch to the Mac and see if the gremlin is killed.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It is very likely that the drive is going to be formatted with the &lt;a href="http://www.whoi.edu/CIS/services/desktop/macintosh/about/extended_format.html">&amp;quot;Mac Os Extended&amp;quot; filesystem&lt;/a>, but I'm not sure about &lt;a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107249">journalling&lt;/a> yet. The disadvantage of all this is that the drive can not be used to transfer files between a PC and a Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still it feels funny. Some people actually can create 100GB+ Fat32 partitions they can use on their Macs. I can read and write to the drive too, but at some point my Mac decides it has been enough and kills itself (probably after finding the windows crud ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry for the linking-frenzy, I had a lot of links I wanted to share with you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dodenherdenking (2)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/04/dodenherdenking-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2006 15:52:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/05/04/dodenherdenking-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Vorig jaar heb ik mij aardig druk gemaakt over de abnormale manier waarop steeds meer mensen met dodenherdenking omgaan. Dit jaar was mijn ervaring gelukkig een stuk prettiger. Ik heb een klein stukje van de herdenking op de dam gezien, en dat was duidelijk een stuk beter dan vorig jaar. De taptoe werd foutloos en netjes geblazen, zelfs toen er (hoorbaar) iets omviel. Chapeau. Ook het inzetten van het volkslied waarbij mensen spontaan mee begonnen te zingen was erg goed om te horen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Na de herdenking ben ik overgestapt op de uitzending vanaf de &lt;a href="http://www.grebbeberg.nl/">Grebbeberg&lt;/a>. Minder (geen) toespraken, een stuk beter. Van mij mag het commentaar bij de uitzending ook nog weg, dat past beter bij het &amp;quot;geen toespraken&amp;quot; beleid en zorgt ook voor minder gewauwel &amp;quot;kijk er staan veel mensen&amp;quot;... Ja dat zie ik! Geluid uit, en probleem opgelost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nee (nogmaals) ik ben geen herdenkinsfanaat, maar ik vind dat mensen wel weer eens wat meer op hun gedrag, respect en elkaar mogen gaan letten. Bijvoorbeeld: Prachtig als je op je blog schrijft dat je je irriteert aan aggressieve weggebruikers, maar geef je ook het goede voorbeeld als je in je auto zit?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse&lt;/a> looks really nice on OS X. I can tell, I have it running on my mac Mini duo core. If you have problems getting it to start, and the logfile complains about linker errors, chances are you have the PPC version of the eclipse app file. To check this, Ctrl-click on the eclipse.app file. If it doesn't say &amp;quot;(Universal)&amp;quot; somewhere next to &amp;quot;Type:&amp;quot;, then you need to download a newer version. Get the &lt;a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.2RC2-200604281315/index.php">Eclipse 3.2 RC2&lt;/a> or higher, and make sure you download the &amp;quot;Mac OSX (Mac/Carbon)&amp;quot; version.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> I was worried about not being able to develop older java versions. Particularly installing an older version of Java on my Mac worried me. But Eclipse gave me a nice surprise: OS X has all Java versions installed by default (1.3 up to 1.5), and eclipse auto-detects them! Brilliant! Next up: Installing Maven.&lt;/p>

It is a great read, and I think it would make a nice adventure movie.

&lt;p>Just now, I had a terrible experience with my new Mac Mini. It crashed on me, two times in a row. It did this while importing a movie from a Sony Handycam with iMovie. During the import, suddenly the screen goes blank, and the machine does a &amp;quot;hard boot&amp;quot;. I restarted iMovie, dragged the imported files from the trashcan and continued as normal. But now I've noticed that my Spotlight is no longer returning search results. Looking for &amp;quot;Terminal&amp;quot; resulted in amsolutely no results at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I checked the /var/log/system.log for errors, but I can only find the things logged during boot. I expected to find some kind of error just prior to the unscheduled boot, but there is none. The problem is so &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; that the system doesn't even get (or takes) the time to write information about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to repair the Spotlight database with the &lt;a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/spotlight.html">tips found here&lt;/a>, and found the solution. Open the Terminal (from Application/utilities) and do the following (requires root password, be carefull!):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rolf:/var/log rolf$ sudo mdutil -E /
Password:
/:
Volume index removed. Index will be rebuilt automatically.
rolf:/var/log rolf$ sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/MAXTOR\ FS/
/Volumes/MAXTOR FS/:
Indexing disabled for volume.
rolf:/var/log rolf$ sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/MAXTOR\ FS/
/Volumes/MAXTOR FS/:
Volume index removed.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Yes, you noticed correctly, I turned off indexing on my Maxtor 250 USB disk and cleaned it's database as well. Spotlight indexes USB disks, and I thought it best to focus on indexing the system disk first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After doing this I waited for Spotlight to finish indexing. You can tell when it's finished by clicking on the magnifying glas. It takes about 2-3 minutes to finish on my machine. After it finished I still had no results. To give the system a chance to clean up and restart I shut it down, and powered it back up. Problem solved! Spotlight works fine again (phew).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and another tip: don't minimize iMovie when importing a movie from your camera, it will stop importing, but leaves the tape running, letting you think it is still working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems that although OS X is more stable than Windows, and can cope better with unexpected reboots (never lost a file during this whole adventure), it is not entirely bullet proof. If I find a way to avoid reboots in iMovie I'll let you know. Smaller projects and more saving is the way to go for now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting with different users to 1 server (2)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/28/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2006 16:07:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/28/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This is a simple followup after my last post. Pim did also &lt;a href="http://zwet.com/2006/04/27/mounting-shares-with-applescript/">look into this&lt;/a>, and made a script which doesn't pop up finders by simply calling &amp;quot;mount&amp;quot;. There is only one minor glitch: the script pops up an error when the mount already exists. With my brilliant programming expertise, I quickly solved that:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>try
mount volume &amp;quot;cifs://KAGE/iTunes&amp;quot; as user name &amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;
with password &amp;quot;yourpasswordhere&amp;quot;
mount volume &amp;quot;cifs://KAGE/incomming&amp;quot; as user name &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot;
mount volume &amp;quot;cifs://KAGE/foto&amp;quot; as user name &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot;
on error errText number errNum
(* Not the nice way, simply ignore errors. If the mount did
not work, the user needs to see what is going on. How?
Use Finder to mount, and it will give you the error *)
end try
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This script will try to mount the drives, ignoring errors. Replace the servernames, usernames and passwords with your own. What you can do is run the script at logon, or every minute in a cron job. I checked /var/log/system.log, but the script does not generate errors there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the rate we're going, maybe we'll even solve the &amp;quot;re-mount drives on return from sleep&amp;quot; problem. Let's see if we can find a wakeup event on which we can run the script.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting with different users to 1 server</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/27/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2006 16:08:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/27/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server/</guid><description>
&lt;p>With my Mac mini in a Windows LAN, I have the following problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. I can add my (cifs windows) network shares to my login script (Preferences -&amp;gt; Accounts -&amp;gt; Login), but when the mac wakes up from sleep, they are gone.
2. When I want to connect to 2 shares on the same server, but one with a different account than the other, it doesn't work. On login, the system chooses one of the accounts and uses it to connect to both network shares.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I think both problems are terrible, and particularly the way you connect to a network share in Finder using a password is confusing to say the least. Searching the web reveals hundreds of posts of people having the same problems. One wonders why apple didn't solve this already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a simple workaround for this problem by copy/pasting some script from several websites into the script editor (sorry guys, I'm lazy). I then saved it both as application and as source. I use the script to mount the drives at logon, and re-mount them when the Mac wakes from sleep mode. Until I come up with a better idea, or somebody can point to a nicer &amp;quot;Apple way&amp;quot; solution, or Apple fixes this dreadful problem in OS X, here is my script:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>tell application &amp;quot;Finder&amp;quot;
open location &amp;quot;cifs://WORKGROUP;iTunes@KAGE/iTunes&amp;quot;
open location &amp;quot;cifs://WORKGROUP;Guest@KAGE/incomming&amp;quot;
end tell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When running a script like this for the first time, the system asks you the passwords. Type them in and save them in your keyring. The next time they won't be asked, and you have no readable passwords in your script. Nice. The downside of this script is that it opens a ton of finder windows. I have nosed around in Automator but can not find a way to close them automatically. I also tried to record a script, but that gave me an even more &amp;quot;unusable&amp;quot; script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this helps you too. If you think this can be done in a nicer way (without too much scripting) please let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Seems I was to quick about the keyring app. I did need to add passwords to the script (add &amp;quot;:password&amp;quot; after the userid without the quotes). Stupid machine does not understand what I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flip4Mac 2.0.2 does not install on Intel Macs</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/24/flip4mac-202-does-not-install-on-intel-macs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2006 16:09:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/24/flip4mac-202-does-not-install-on-intel-macs/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Bummer, I was hoping to be able to open those wmv files I get mailed in the Quicktime window. Although OS X claims to be supporting Flip4Mac since 10.4.5 (I have 10.4.6), the &lt;a href="http://www.flip4mac.com/wmv_download.htm">Flip4Mac installer&lt;/a> exits with a message about not being able to install on Intel based hardware.I guess I'll have to live with -gasp- &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/windowsmediaplayerformacosx.html">Windows Media Player 9 for OS X&lt;/a> for now. I tried to install it, but it requires mee to enable the Microsoft Office testdrive kit, which I am definetely NOT planning on doing, wmv files are not worth those troubles. I am hoping on a universal binary Flip4Mac soon...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny thing is, that the Windows Media player for OS X is actually only 7 MB in size. I seem to recall that Media Player 10 for Windows XP took quote some time downloading, and ate nearly all of the free space on my harddisk, which I was really pissed about. But then again, since they require me to enable the Microsoft Office testdrive, they have probably allready sneaked part of the player into the OS X distribution, the bastards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Comment from Antonio on how to solve this: &lt;em>You can get Flip4Mac to work through Rosetta, but Telestream is a couple weeks away from releasing a public Universal beta version. Check this blog for some details and other info bits: &lt;a href="http://flip4mac.blogspot.com/">http://flip4mac.blogspot.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My response: _Great, just used the tip on blogspot, and it worked! I can now view wmv files nicely. Thanks for the tip! _&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting iChat to work with Googletalk</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/23/getting-ichat-to-work-with-googletalk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2006 16:12:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/23/getting-ichat-to-work-with-googletalk/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This is probably the 1001st post about this subject, but I can't help thinking that some people actually give up on this. It is a simple protocol, simple program and should be simple to get working. I spent a few hours (!) before I finaly found the solution. I searched the internet but this answer never seems to be given on forums. I'll try to be complete, so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Configure iChat as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24076">described by Google&lt;/a>. If you still can not connect, there is a good chance you have started the firewall on your mac, and it is blocking iChat. Open the system preferences, and in the &amp;quot;Internet and network&amp;quot; section select &amp;quot;Share&amp;quot;. You will notice a firewall tab in the middle. Select it, and make sure there is a thickmark next to &amp;quot;iChat Bonjour&amp;quot;, like in this screenshot:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_firewall-ichat.gif" alt="iChatÂ settings">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Sorry for the Dutch layout, I'm sure you'll find it with this pointer.)
This action solved my iChat connection problem. I also installed &lt;a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium&lt;/a>, which also had connection problems. The firewall setting solved the Adium problems aswell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm not sure which chat client to choose. iChat is more integrated into OSX, and imported my google contacts without a problem. Adium did not import any contacts. I'm sticking to iChat for now, hoping that the integration with the rest of the system will give me some pleasant surprises.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and yes, you've noticed correctly, I've bought a Mac. The desktop PC at home crashed one time too many.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Want those CD boxes back?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/23/want-those-cd-boxes-back/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2006 16:11:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/04/23/want-those-cd-boxes-back/</guid><description>
&lt;p>When I used iTunes on XP, I was jealous of the terrific plugins for iTunes running on OS X. Now that I have a Mac Mini, I was looking for a plugin to update the album art automatically. &lt;a href="http://www.zwet.com/">Pim&lt;/a> showed me an even better alternative: &lt;a href="http://www.sprote.com/clutter/">Clutter&lt;/a>! Not only can it search and update album art automatically for you, it also gives you the option to put your albums on your desktop. This is the best virtual alternative to having CD's lying on your desk. A must have for iTunes users I think. Very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sidebar: My file server still runs Windows, and it has been working flawlessly for the past 5 years, being constantly &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; and storing family pictures and music. My laptop is an XP machine and works quite nicely too. So maybe it's because I don't need to, but for now I don't want to &lt;a href="http://zwet.com/2006/04/20/apple-switch-complete-but-the-demon-is-still-here/">install XP on my Mac&lt;/a>. It feels like a step back, it adds a sour taste to your strawberry icecream :-). XP is nice, but not as a desktop.

&lt;/a>Party today! The rotor puller I ordered last month finally arrived after being in transit for over a MONTH, &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; United States Parcel Services! They probably sent somebody to swim accros the ocean with my parcel on his back. Judging by the shipping costs, the swimmer had enough food luxury during his trip. I really hope that Pit Posse selects a different shipping company for international orders soon. I took the torch and heated the rotor until water drops put on it boiled, to soften the retainer (lock tight) between the axle and the rotor. Then I re-tightened the rotor puller, smacked it with a hammer, re-tightened it, and so forth. The fifth hit did it, the rotor popped out. As you can see in the first picture, I had a fire extinguisher close by, because oil and fire do not play well together. I also used gloves so I could grab hot metal parts if needed, and I used aluminum plates to protect the magnet from direct heat of the torch.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>Kawasaki KLR wrenching fanatics will notice the missing balancer chain tensioner (or &amp;quot;doohickey&amp;quot;, as they are sometimes called). Don't worry, it's still in one piece, I took it off to straighten it. It was bent and worn by the holding bolt, and I don't want the bolt to sit or crawl to it's former spot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also checked the valve fittings by putting petroleum in the head. They do not seem to be leaking, and show now signs of abnormal wear. Next week I will be checking the old oil for metal splinters, and putting it all together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Airbus 330 Entertainent system</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/03/31/airbus-330-entertainent-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2006 19:36:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/03/31/airbus-330-entertainent-system/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I recently went to Vegas, which is a very long trip (about 20 hours including stopover). I don't like flying that much, my ears hurt and it is very boring to be crammed in a chair for 10 hours, with a headrest that makes your chin touch your chest no matter how you adjust it. However, on this flight (and the one back) there was a nice personal entertainment system installed in each chair.Below are some images of the personal entertainment system which is installed on the Airbus 330's of Northwest Airlines. These are a real treat on long distance flights. There is a fair selection of on-demand movies, music, some simple games and flight information. It lets you choose a movie, and you can pause and skip as much as you like. You can use your own 3.5mm jacked headphones, no more of that adapter-buying-if-you-are-lucky-you'll-get-stereo crap you see in the older planes. The menu even contained an item called &amp;quot;email&amp;quot;, but it was not functioning at the time I tried it. Besides you had to swipe your credit card for it, which I didn't find worth trying even if it would work.&lt;/p>

Funny thing is, that my wife's entertainent system actually crashed during flight. It got stuck for about 5 minutes, after which it automatically rebooted, and guess what? I saw a Tux! It is actually a Linux system. A bit of googling revealed that a few people even have seen the system crash on [all monitors at the same time](http://www.flickr.com/photos/milliped/116393699/). Good thing they aren't using this system for the flight controls yet. ;-)
&lt;p>But it does make sense. It doesn't cost anything, and being open source, Panasonic (the manufacturer of the system) has full controll on getting all the glitches out. Now they actually do need to do that still, but I bet they got a nice (remote?) update procedure for that. After all, they also need to upload new movies every now and then. Maybe they use the same connection as they use for email? 100% remote update would be nice. No &amp;quot;downtime&amp;quot; for the planes!.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I for one liked the system very much. It actually has games which let you compete with other passengers, but that didn't seem to be popular on my flights to Las Vegas. I didn't even had to get my PSP out of my bag :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now if they only could make those stupid headrests removable so I can put my head back when I want to sleep (like most normal people), flying wouldn't be all that bad.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Soybean racer</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/03/12/soybean-racer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2006 19:42:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/03/12/soybean-racer/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The big car manufacturers could have done &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/17/eveningnews/main1329941.shtml">this&lt;/a>, but they didn't, because they are sponsored by the big oil companies. And your local governement is swimming in taxmoney that's added to your oil price. And no, they don't want to get rid of the cars, despite of what they say. The nicest thing for governements would be the complete population sitting in single-seated, gas guzzling cars in a traffic jam accross the country!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that a few school kids have proven that you don't need oil to race, and several American race series run on methanol (no that's not an oil product), can we please stop making cars that run on gasoline? And by the way, also stop pumping money into the super-dangerous liquid nitrogen cars? All that is purely to keep the oil companies in the same place: monopoly. Do you really think they do it for the environment? What if I told you that your current petrol car can run on bio-degradable methanol, with almost no changes? If you have a very modern car, the fuel system will even auto-adapt! But noooo, they won't tell you that, because the oil companies and governements want to keep the monopoly intact!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not that you can really do anything about it though. Except maybe not buying liquid-nitrogen or hybrid cars. There are better technical alternatives, although not on the market yet. Boycot the &amp;quot;environmentally friendly&amp;quot; car, force them into making a &lt;em>real&lt;/em> environmentally friendly car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I'm driving a diesel, and a motorbike. And no, I'm not worried about oil-shortage. It's all bullshit from the oil companies, who could have come up with alternatives a long while ago, but chose not to. If there really was an oil shortage, we all would have been driving on methanol for quite some time now. And co2 emmisions would have been reduced to absolutely 0.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to replace the headlights on a Citroen Xsara</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/03/11/how-to-replace-the-headlights-on-a-citroen-xsara/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2006 19:43:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/03/11/how-to-replace-the-headlights-on-a-citroen-xsara/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Recently my left headlight broke. I thought I'd change it quickly, but after half an hour of fiddling I decided to ask my dealer to do it for me, while I was looking. That was not a bad idea. It turned out to be not so straightforward after all, and you actually need tools (which you don't get when buying the car) to do this! This lead me to write a &amp;quot;small&amp;quot; article on how to replace the headlights of a Citroen Xsara. Enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![My Citroen Xsara 1.4 Hdi](r_citroen-xsara-break-14-hdi.thumbnail.jpg)
&lt;p>](r_citroen-xsara-break-14-hdi.jpg)** The Car**
This is my Citroen Xsara break 1.4 HDi. No, that's not the picasso model, you've seen that right. I think car manufacturers need to stop naming a complete line of cars with just one name. Nobody knows what car you are driving, even if you tell them. Good examples are the Citroen Xsara and the Renault Megane. But that's not what this article is about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently my left headlight broke. I thought I'd change it quickly, but after half an hour of fiddling I decided to ask my dealer to do it for me, while I was looking. That was not a bad idea. It turned out to be not so straightforward after all, and you actually need tools to do this! You will need a 10mm wrench and a screwdriver. If you have thick fingers, I'd recommend a pair of pliers as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote the whole procedure down here, for other Xsara owners to read. It can save you a costly trip to the garage, or a trip without headlights in a very dark area. The left headlight is the hardest to replace, the right headlight can be done without tools (although still a bit hard to reach).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Click on the images to zoom in)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-headlight-booklet-picture.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-headlight-booklet-picture.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Headlight from the manual">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>1. Check the manual&lt;/strong>
The first thing you need to do (if you care for a laugh) is check the manual on &amp;quot;changing lights&amp;quot;. You will find a nice picture of the back of the headlight unit, with arrows pointing to the different lights. Surely this is to motivate you to do it yourself, but they kindly &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; to include the 9 missing steps to even get to the rear of the headlight unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-remove-cover-arrow.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-remove-cover-arrow.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Left Engine Cover clips">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>2. Remove left engine cover&lt;/strong>
Open up the hood (or stop reading here if you can't ;-). You will see some plastic engine covers. Yes, those are the same covers you need to remove on the right side to fill up your windshield wiper fluid. The first sign the designer must have been a complete and utter idiot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the left headlight, remove the left engine cover (that's the right one if you are facing the front bumper ;-). Turn the little knobs 90 degrees counter clockwise and carefully lift up the plastic. The knobs are very flimsy, be careful not to break them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-remove-air-intake-tube-arrows.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-remove-air-intake-tube-arrows.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Aire Intake Tube">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>3. Remove air intake tube&lt;/strong>
The air intake tube is connected to a plastic box behind the headlight, with a bajonet lock. Turn the top of the tube slightly towards you, and then pull it out of the plastic box.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-remove-air-intake-box-screw-arrow.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-remove-air-intake-box-screw-arrow.thumbnail.jpg" alt="air intake box nut">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>4. Remove air intake box nut&lt;/strong>
Below where the air intake tube was, you will find a 10mm nut hodling the bottom of the air intake box. Use a 10mm wrench to undo it. Be careful not to drop it into the engine compartment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-remove-air-intake-peg.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-remove-air-intake-peg.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Remove air intake box peg">

&lt;/a>&lt;strong>5. Remove air intake box peg&lt;/strong>
The top of the air intake box is held by a plastic peg. To pull the center pin out, you'll need to lift the pin with a screwdriver (look carefully at the picture). It should not take much force to take it out, please be carefull with this piece of plastic. I think Citroen will charge a pretty unfair amount of money to replace it should you've broken or lost it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-remove-abs-plug-cover-arrow.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-remove-abs-plug-cover-arrow.thumbnail.jpg" alt="ABS plug cover">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>6. Remove ABS plug cover&lt;/strong>
Allways wanted to know what that aluminum box is with those steel lines comming out the top? Well that's your anti-blocking system unit, and you're about to disconnect it. First, you need to remove the cover which protects the plug from moisture. You better change your headlights while it is not raining, because chances are that your ABS will stop working if you get the connector to corrode.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;strong>7. Unlock and remove ABS plug&lt;/strong>
Pull out the red handle. The ABS connector plug should almost immediately loosen, and removing the connector should take absolutely &lt;em>no force&lt;/em>. If it sticks, you probably didn't pull out the red handle enough. Carefully look at the picture.&lt;/p>

The lamp cover is a simple plastic lid. Just pull it away from the headlight unit.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>&lt;strong>10. Remove lamp clip&lt;/strong>
With a flashlight, you can see that the lamp is held in place by a clip. This clip has two handles at the top of the lamp. Push them towards the headlight unit, and then outward. The lamp can now be taken out. Please take note on it's orientation when taking it out, there is only one way of putting it back in without damaging your headlight unit or blinding oncomming traffic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-headlight-h7-out.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-headlight-h7-out.thumbnail.jpg" alt="The H7 Lamp out of itâs reflector">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>11. Replace lamp&lt;/strong>
Replace the lamp with a H7 type lamp, again note the orientation of the lamp. Don't touch the glass with your fingers. Touching the glass will leave grease on the glass. When the lamp heats up, it will become hotter than normal, shortening it's lifetime. Even worse: the grease will vaporize and leave a non-removable milky deposit on your reflectors. Reflectors are very expensive to replace. The dealer will charge you for a complete headlight unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_citroen-reinstall-air-intake-box-arrows.jpg">&lt;img src="r_citroen-reinstall-air-intake-box-arrows.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Reinstall Air Intake Box (arrows)">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>12. Put it all back together&lt;/strong>
Connect the lamp and make sure it is working. After that, re-install all parts in revers order. Make sure that when you re-install the air intake box, the clips (pointed out by arrows 1 and 2 in the picture) are around the steel rimm. If the air intake box is not correctly placed, the plastic pin will not go through the misaligned holes, and the bottom slot will not align with the thread on which the 10mm nut goes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this will help other owners of Citroen Xsara's in replacing their own headlights. If you do not feel confident of something when replacing your headlights, please contact your local dealer. Needless to say, messing aroung with your brake system should be done with care and professionalism.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take care!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Inventive minds</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/28/inventive-minds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2006 20:17:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/28/inventive-minds/</guid><description>

&lt;p>... maybe the title should be &amp;quot;Two Stupidities A Week&amp;quot;, but since both stupid actions had to do with measurement, or rather the lack thereof, let's stick with the proverb.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3626.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3626.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Selfmade rotorpuller next to oldÂ one">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Stupidity #1&lt;/strong>
Last Saturday my brother and I went to a motorbike scrapyard for some advice, and maybe a new rotorpuller we could borrow. While talking to the guy, it became clear that either I am treating the rotor with too much love and care, or this guy turns into the Hulk when he pulls rotors. He gave us the advice to try again, and:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;quot;Don't force it, get a larger hammer!&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we set out to get the larger hammer. While getting the hammer I got the brilliant idea to only use the outer bolt of the rotorpuller, so that it sat against the flat outer end of the crank. That way we could hit it harder without the risk of tearing up the threads inside the crank.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I turned the puller into the rotor, tightened it, and started hitting it with the hammer. Nothing happened. After hitting it, I could hardly remove the puller from the rotor. It appeared to be forged shorter and thicker by the hammering. The threads looked strangely damaged. When I overlooked the damages a day later, it occured to me that the rotor puller was rather short. And yes, mesaurements confirmed that it never could have touched the crank. It turns out that I was actually hammering the rotor &lt;strong>onto&lt;/strong> the crank, and killing the puller in the process. The thread in the rotor still looked pertty intact. Phew.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Stupidity #2&lt;/strong>
The rotor puller now being officially useless, I started browsing the internet to see what type of bolt I would need to pull the rotor of a Kawasaki KL650B block. I found a site, telling me I needed a 20mm bolt, with 1.5mm thread. That's an ISO fine M20x1.5 bolt. So I set out to get one. 20mm bolts are not common in your local hardware store. One hardware store could actually find where he could order it, but refused to do that (I will never walk into WALCO hardware store next to Haarlem Central Station again). I would have gladly payed any shipping costs, he had no idea, and he never asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I have a lathe, I decided to put some time in it. My local favourite hardware store had 20mm round steel (the thickest they had) , so I bought a meter of it. With my lathe I cut the 1.5mm thread onto it, which actually worked quote nice. I only broke a cutter on the last pass, stopping too late. I have to find out how to prevent that from happening the next time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I removed the workpiece from the lathe, and tried to screw it into the rotor. Guess what? It was too small! If I had taken 15 seconds to measure the rotor before buying the steel, I would have saved myself a lot of work. After uploading this story I will try to order a puller online, because I can't find larger steel rods today, and the rotor puller is nothing more than a $3,00 bolt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Or maybe I feel like using my lathe again next week, who knows... But then I will use my measure calipers first, last, and very often in between, because: &lt;em>You Can't Fix What You Don't Measure!&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Killing oracle sessions, the easy (JDBC) way.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/23/killing-oracle-sessions-the-easy-jdbc-way/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Feb 2006 20:27:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/23/killing-oracle-sessions-the-easy-jdbc-way/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Does Oracle complain about not being able to drop a table for a currently connected user, but you are sure you disconnected? Do the sessions &amp;quot;hang&amp;quot; in &amp;quot;inactive&amp;quot; state? Just log on as system, and execute the following query:Â &lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>SELECT
'ALTER SYSTEM KILL SESSION ''' || sid || ',' || serial# || '''; --',
s.sid,
s.serial#,
s.osuser,

WHERE status = 'INACTIVE';
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You will get a list of statements you need to execute (just copy-pase) to kill the inactive sessions. Don't listen to the guys telling you to do intricate System Administrator stuff on a command prompt, just use any JDBC tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>EDIT:&lt;/strong> Single query which also lists the kill command if the &amp;quot;alter system kill session&amp;quot; trick did not work:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>SELECT

s.status
FROM v$session s, v$process p
WHERE s.paddr = p.addr
and (s.state='INACTIVE' or s.state='KILLED');
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3581.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3581.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Kawasaki KL 650 Tengai crankshaft drawing">
&lt;/a>Last week I tried to pull the rotor by using a rotor puller, and a socket (from a socket wrench set) to block it. The socket burried it's way into the first thread of the crankshaft. After realising this, I tried to fit the rotor bolt, and it wouldn't go in. Since only the first thread was damaged, I carefully drilled it out (only needed to go 2 mm deep), and now the rotor bolt fits nicely again.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3574.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3574.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Kawasaki Rotor bolt made into Rotor puller stub">
&lt;/a>To prevent this from happening again, I ordered a new rotorbolt, and changed the old one to a stub to rest the rotor puller against. You can see the stub on the left. This is needed because the crankshaft is hollow, and the rotor puller has nothing to press against.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This evening, I spent another few hours of battering the crankshaft and the rotorpuller, still nothing. No matter what I do, the rotor does not want to let go of the crankshaft. I even tried heating the rotor up until the point I could not touch it with my hands. I protected the magnets from direct heat of the flame with a strip of aluminium, but I didn't want to take the risk to melt the plastic holding them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3580.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3580.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Rotor puller side view">
&lt;/a>&lt;a href="r_img_3579.jpg">&lt;img src="r_img_3579.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Rotor puller after failed attemt to pull kawaÂ rotor">
&lt;/a>In the process, my trusty old rotor puller even almost gave up on me, I think it is time for it's retirement. The thread inside the nut is defintely at it's end, and the handle is bent out of shape from the force applied to try to seperate the rotor from the crank. That, and the beating of the hammer on the inside bolt has turned this rotor puller into a paper weight (almost).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to give it another rest, I'm going to a motorbike exposition/dealer show next friday, maybe I can talk to people there about my problem. Sometimes the experienced bike repair shops have simple but effective tips to solve seemingly impossible problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make my evening productive I measured the valve clearances. They are pretty nice, only 1 valves is slightly low on their clearance. This strikes me as funny because usually the clearance increases because of wear. Maybe the original clearance was allready low, or the disassembly and reassembly of the head has changed the clearing because I tightened the bolts a bit harder, I don't know. I am fairly sure I measured the clearances correctly, and at the correct camshaft angles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Clearances are:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >
&lt;/td>
left
right
Allowed
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
exhaust
&lt;td >0.15mm (just enough)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >0.09mm (0.06 too little)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >0.15~0.25mm
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
inlet
&lt;td >0.12mm (spot on)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >0.15mm (spot on)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >0.10~0.20mm
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
So, I probaly need to buy a 0.06mm to 0.1mm thinner shim for the right exhaust valve cam to be on the safe side, but I will re-measure the clearances once the head is on the bike, to see how much the wrenching influences the measurements.</description></item><item><title>Google Talk with your browser!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/08/google-talk-with-your-browser/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Feb 2006 20:39:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/08/google-talk-with-your-browser/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Getting the &amp;quot;Could not find an adaptor for class Foo&amp;quot; Mesage in Tapestry? You probably forgot to make your class Serializable. A simple description of a possible problematic situation follows:Â &lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Suppose you have some simple class, like so:
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public class MyItem {
private String itemname;
public String getItemname() {
return itemname;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>And somewhere in your Tapestry page or component, you iterate a list of these items to produce directlinks for each of them:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;span jwcid=&amp;quot;@Foreach&amp;quot; source=&amp;quot;ognl:myItems&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;ognl:loopItem&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;a jwcid=&amp;quot;@DirectLink&amp;quot; listener=&amp;quot;ognl:listeners.myItemListener&amp;quot;
parameters=&amp;quot;ognl:new java.lang.Object[] {loopItem}&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;span jwcid=&amp;quot;@Insert&amp;quot; value=&amp;quot;ognl:loopItem.itemname&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>In your page definition, you have created a nice listener method which you expect to be called:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public void myItemListener(IRequestCycle cycle){
MyItem item = (MyItem)cycle.getServiceParameters()[0];
System.out.println(
&amp;quot;Hi, you have pressed the link for &amp;quot;
+ item.getItemname());
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You start everything up, but when loading the page, Tapestry complains:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>org.apache.tapestry.ApplicationRuntimeException:
Could not find an adaptor for class MyItem.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>... and a horrific stacktrace follows, which you can't read or understand because it is all about AbstractComponent.renderbody and other internals of Tapestry and your webserver. Although the error is terrible, and does not point you anywhere, the fix is rather simple. You forgot to make your class Serializable! Changing it to :&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public class MyItem implement Serializable {
private String itemname;
public String getItemname() {
return itemname;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>fixes the problem, because now Tapestry can serialize your object into the session, and pass it as a parameter to the listener.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>195Nm Victory!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/07/195nm-victory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Feb 2006 20:46:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/07/195nm-victory/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3569.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3569.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Kawasaki Rotor Holder (from workshop manual)">
&lt;/a>For some strange reason, my brother's Kawasaki KLR Tengai dead-stopped. After starting it again, it made some strange noises. It also had lost a lot of oil somewhere along the way, so we decided to not run it again before we found the cause of the trouble. A few weeks ago we encountered a funny problem, we couldn't loosen the rotor-bolt. In the Kawasaki KLR workshop manual is a picture of a strange wrench to hold the rotor. Ofcourse we're cheap, so we wouldn't spring for a nifty and probably expensive Kawasaki specialty tool for a very old bike which not worth more than the petrol that's in the tank (okay, okay, but you get the point).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3565.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3565.thumbnail.jpg" alt="32mm wrench, colored from heating">
&lt;/a>The rotor bolt is tightened to 195Nm. That's a lot of force there, so it's not surprising we couldn't loosen it by holding the flywheeel with our hands. So we set out to create a tool of our own. We even ended up trying to bend an old 32mm Chrome-Vanadium wrench, which resulted in an empty gas can, a very hot workbench and nice colors on the wrench, without it bending even the slightest. We we barely able to heat it to the point it got red-hot, because the metal just conducts the heat away from the point you want to heat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3567.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3567.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Holding the piston to loosen the rotor-bolt (overview)">
&lt;/a>So I started mailing with Vincent, a good friend of mine which happens to be &lt;a href="http://www.zodiac.nl/dragrace/index2.htm">&amp;quot;quite handy&amp;quot; with motorbikes&lt;/a> . He pointed out that you could also stop the rotor from turning by holding the piston. Because we wanted to measure the play in the bigend bearing we needed to remove the sleeve anyway, so I immediately went back to the workshop to do this. After removing the sleeve, I could easily make some wood pegs to block the piston. The wood would have to have a big surface and be strong enough to hould the piston, without damaging the piston or the engine casing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3566.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3566.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Holding the piston to loosen the rotor-bolt (detail)">
&lt;/a>It turned out to work great! I needed to attach a long bar to the socket wrench to be able to apply enough force to the bolt, but in the end I got it! In the picture on the left you can see a detail of how the wood blocks are resting on the engine casing. After loosening the bolt, there was absolutely no visible damage to the piston or the engine. Even greater news is that there is also virtually no play on the bigend bearing, so we don't have to disasemble the crank.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3568.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3568.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Wearmarks from applying 195Nm to theÂ bolt">
&lt;/a>When looking at the bolt, the results of applying so much force to the faces of the socket wrench become visible. We know for a fact that this bolt has been removed once before, so these wearmarks are from tightening and loosening the bolt just two times. I think we can tighten it one more time, but after that it needs to be replaced.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Foxit PDF Reader</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/05/foxit-pdf-reader/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Feb 2006 20:49:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/02/05/foxit-pdf-reader/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In the early days, Adobe Acrbat Reader was a great tool for reading PDF files. But in the past months, it has transformed into a slow-starting, update hungry irritating tool which pops up questions about upgrading parts of the program you didn't even request to be installed. If you have the older version of Acrobat Reader without the update manager, hang on to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you are looking for a nice alternative for Acrobat Reader, I can recommend &lt;a href="http://www.foxitsoftware.com/pdf/rd_intro.php">Foxit PDF Reader&lt;/a>. It is a very small program, free, and starts up in about 1/10th of the time Acrobat Reader takes to display just the splash screen (and subsequently, the annoying update manager). It can do anything I usually need when reading and printing PDF files, and the fullscreen mode is even richer than Adobe's.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adobe seems to have gone overboard with their userinterface. People just want to read the PDF, and not be bothered with complicated questions which very often result in downloading and installing megabytes of unwanted software on their machines. I will recommend alternatives to Acrobat Reader from now on, and I think the world will become a slightly better place ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My movie rating</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/01/24/my-movie-rating/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2006 20:55:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/01/24/my-movie-rating/</guid><description>

&lt;p>For those that can read Dutch. &lt;a href="http://www.nos.nl/nos/artikelen/2006/01/art00006006024D.html">This&lt;/a> is a nice example of Dutch gasstation owners wanting to be compensated for the fact that gasoline (or any other fluid you can sell) schrinks when cooled.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->What happens is, that the delivery trucks cary the gasoline at the normal outside temperatures. When pumped into the underground tanks at the station, the number of liters is measured and the gasstation owner gets charged for those liters. Then, the gasoline cools down (and shrinks!) because it is stored underground. So when de car owners put the gas in their car, the cold ("smaller") liters get measured and the gasstation owner is "swindled by nature" because het can only sell say 99 liters of gasoline, while he bought 100 from the oil company!
&lt;p>Now, things get better because the gassstation owner wants to be compensated for this law of nature! It's like wanting to be compensated for the fact that you get wet when you jump in the water.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let's say this is &lt;em>really&lt;/em> a problem, because in my opinion it isn't, they make enough money and they could have known this upfront if they have had payed attention in first grade. You can basically do two things about this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Insulate the underground tank, and maybe even heat it. You can actually now &amp;quot;swindle&amp;quot; the car owners, because you can sell them &amp;quot;more&amp;quot; petrol than you have bought from the oil company! Woopee!. You might want to check your heating bill at the end of the year though, I doubt it will do you any good.
2. We can start selling petrol/gasoline by *kilograms*, which is actually allready standard in some forms of industry. It's a bit harder to measure, but absolutely independant of the temperature of the product

&lt;p>Even companies pretending to know about ICT, writing about companies doing it right or wrong, get it (very) wrong sometimes. People who have an account at &lt;a href="http://automatiseringgids.sdu.nl/ag/inlogpagina.jsp">De Automatiseringsgids&lt;/a> know the login screen. But have they also noticed how their username and password are sent to the server in plain text?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another funny thing a colleque of mine discovered is the really wierd way of displaying error messages. The server returns the error message as part of a redirect. Yes, you've read that correctly. No serverside things here guys, must keep memory usage down. No sessions here, move along... A really funny thing you can do is display your own error messages, like so: &lt;a href="http://automatiseringgids.sdu.nl/ag/inlogpagina.jsp?message=%3Ch1%3EWie%20dit%20leest%20is%20gek%3C/h1%3E"> De automatiseringsgids with weird error&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_clipboard02.gif">&lt;img src="o_clipboard02.thumbnail.gif" alt="Wie dit leest is gek">
&lt;/a>I think somebody will start playing with this, because you can do a lot more (very bad) things. Should they have it fixed allready when you are reading this, I saved a screenshot for you. You would have got something in the lines of this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After discussing this wierd construction, we concluded that the programmers wanted to do a &amp;quot;post-by-redirect&amp;quot; construction, where you make the server return a redirect to the browser jsut after a post. This solves the &amp;quot;reload problem&amp;quot; where the browser asks if it can re-post the data for you. Since a redirect is a GET, the browser will just reload the page. Normally you solve this by storing thing in the session on the server and send a session reference to the browser. Combined with HTTP&lt;strong>S&lt;/strong>, this would give you a relatively strong, and still not to expensive protection against scripting and spoofing attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A fine example of what happens if you trust an external company to build your web application, but you &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; to check that they've delivered something that's up to your standards (or at least the standards you paid for). Have fun playing around with this, and let me know what interesting things you found. (hint: Iframes and javascript can do a lot on this page ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GSM Abonnement: Wisselen of blijven?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/01/06/gsm-abonnement-wisselen-of-blijven/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2006 21:04:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2006/01/06/gsm-abonnement-wisselen-of-blijven/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This article is about selecting a new phone contract. Since this article describes a specific Dutch situation, it will be in Dutch. Sorry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dit jaar lijkt een constant &amp;quot;blijven of wisselen&amp;quot; jaar te zijn. Wil je de nieuwe zorgverlof regeling of blijf je spaarloon houden? Wil je een nieuwe Zorgverzekeraar of wil je bij je oude blijven? En vandaag is was mijn beltegoed voor mijn gevoel te snel op, en rees de vraag &amp;quot;Wil je prepaid blijven bellen, of wil je een abonnement?&amp;quot;. Gelukkig was de vraag bij welke provider ik wil blijven snel beantwoord, ik heb altijd goede ervaringen met Vodafone (als bedrijf) gehad dus het moet Vodafone blijven. Ik ben al lid sinds het nog Libertel heette, en heb ook nog steeds hetzelfde nummer.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Hoewel een abonnement al snel goedkoper lijkt, is dat niet altijd het geval, zelfs niet als je een maandje of twee flink wat meer belt dan normaal. Dat komt omdat GSM providers hun tarieven zo kiezen dat ze moeilijk te vergelijken zijn, en vooral ook antrekkelijk lijken te zijn.
&lt;p>Om een beetje wijs te worden uit de Vodafone tarieven heb ik eerst maar een selectie van candidaten gemaakt. Ik ben een prepaid fan omdat ik dan nooit aan het einde van de maand voor een verassende torenhoge rekening kom te staan doordat mijn telefoon per ongeluk ergens is blijven liggen of ik vergeten ben op &amp;quot;gesprek beeindigen&amp;quot; te drukken. Verder heb ik een prima tweedehands Ericcson T610 gekocht die het prima doet dus een abonnement zou van het &amp;quot;Sim Only&amp;quot; type moeten zijn.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Vodafone biedt voor deze situaties de volgende abonnementen:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * **Prepaid**, met het nieuwe &amp;quot;60 minuten halen, 3 betalen&amp;quot; tarief waarbij de eerste 3 minuten van het uur 35 cent kosten, en daarna betaal je niets meer (tot het uur voorbij is maar dat lijkt me een uitzondering). Dit tarief is niet voor niets zo gekozen. Vodafone heeft gemerkt dat de meeste gesprekken van prepaid bellers 3 minuten zijn, en dus gaan ze het schip daar niet mee in.
* **Sim-Only - Vodafone 12.50**, dit is een variant op het normale Vodafone 12.50 abonnement. Omdat je geen telefoon bij het abonnement koopt, krijg je korting. Zo is het maandtarief niet 12.50 zoals de naam suggereert, maar 7.50. Ook de tarieven per minuut liggen lager. Hoewel je een &amp;quot;beltegoed&amp;quot; van 50 minuten hebt, is bellen niet gratis. Bellen kost 9 cent per minuut voor elke minuut **binnen** je beltegoed. Bel je meer dan 50 minuten per maand, dan betaal je voor elke minuut **buiten** je beltegoed het standaardtarief van 25 cent per minuut. Vodafone heeft ook een 17.50, 22.50 en duurdere varianten van dit abonnement. Deze heb ik buiten beschouwing gelaten.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Voor diepgaander analyse moet je zelf maar even naar &lt;a href="http://www.vodafone.nl/">www.vodafone.nl&lt;/a> browsen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_vodafone-tarieven-2006.gif">&lt;img src="o_vodafone-tarieven-2006.gif" alt="Vodafone Tarieven 2006">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In bovenstaande grafiek kunnen we een beetje zien hoe de kosten verlopen. Onderaan van links naar rechts is uitgezet hoeveel minuten je per maand belt. Let op, dit is een gemiddelde, dat je dus niet per maand moet meten, maar over een jaar. Als je namelijk de eerste helft van het jaar bijna niet belt, en de laatste helft van het jaar erg intensief, en je hebt een prepaid abonnement, dan kun je toch nog steeds wel eens heel erg goedkoop uit zijn. Omdat prepaid bellers geen inzicht hebben in hun belgedrag is dit moeilijk te bepalen, je zult de gesprekstellers in je telefoon moeten gebruiken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Omdat het Vodafone prepaid tarief zo raar inelkaar zit, heb ik er 3 grafieken voor gemaakt, eentje voor 3 minuten gemiddeld per gesprek of minder (slechtste geval), 5 minuten per gesprek, en 10 minuten per gesprek. Let op, dit zijn gemiddelden.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uit de grafiek kunnen we de volgende conclusies trekken:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Mensen die 3 minuten of minder per gesprek bellen, en meer dan 40 minuten per maand bellen, zouden kunnen overstappen op een abonnement. (Dit is meer dan 14 gesprekken per maand van 3 minuten of minder)
2. Mensen die gemiddeld 5 minuten per gesprek bellen, en meer dan 100 minuten per maand bellen, zouden kunnen overstappen op een abonnement.
3. Mensen die gemiddeld 6 minuten of langer per gesprek bellen, moeten absoluut niet overstappen op een abonnement. Hoe langer je gesprek duurt (mits binnen het uur) hoe goedkoper je uit bent.
4. Voor gemiddelde bellers (3 minuten per gesprek) liggen de omslagpunten tussen 40 en 110 minuten bellen per maand. Binnen deze band scheelt overstappen tussen abonnementen ruwweg 20% per maand, uitgezonderd overstappen van prepaid naar abonnement.
5. Los van de kosten zijn de abonnementsvormen ook op andere manieren (on)aantrekkelijk: Als je je provider niet leuk vind kun je een prepaid kaart zo in de hoek smijten; aan een abonnement zit je toch vaak minimaal een jaar aan de maandelijkse kosten vast.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Je kunt de grafiek ook andersom lezen: als je 40 euro per maand beltegoed uitgeeft en je bent een gemiddelde &amp;quot;3 minuten&amp;quot; beller, bel je ongeveer 115 minuten per maand. Je kunt dan het beste overstappen op een sim-only vodafone 22.50 abonement overstappen, mits je zeker weet dat je belgedrag niet minder word. Met het 12.50 abonnement ben je iets duurder uit, maar daarbij lopen de kosten sterker terug als je minder gaat bellen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ik hoop dat dit verhaaltje heeft geholpen een betere keuze te maken. Voor mij is het nog steeds niet helemaal duidelijk, omdat mijn belgedrag grillig verloopt over het jaar en ik eigenlijk geen gegevens heb verzameld van afgelopen jaar. Het blijft dus nog even prepaid vrees ik. En ja, ik heb SMS bundels buiten beschouwing gelaten omdat ik een telefoon heb om mee te bellen, en niet om foto's te maken, spelletjes te doen of te SMSen. Telefoons moeten klein, en simpel zijn, zonder teveel toeters en bellen, zonder externe antene en zeker niet uitgerust met schuifjes of uitklapschermen. Alles wat kan bewegen kan ook afbreken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tot slot nog een tip voor prepaid gebruikers van Vodafone: Als je NIET accoord gaat met de nieuwe voorwaarden en je hebt een oude prepaid kaart, bel je dus NIET voor het 60 halen - 3 betalen tarief. Je betaalt dan gewoon 35 cent per minuut voor AL je minuten! Kijk dus even op de Vodafone site hoe je dit kunt veranderen.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Raco Euro Challenge</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/12/22/raco-euro-challenge/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2005 21:12:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/12/22/raco-euro-challenge/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3448.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3448.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Dust in the powersupply of the fileserver">
&lt;/a>...or should I say &amp;quot;Fire prevention&amp;quot;. Nowadays, more and more fires come from computers left running overnight. Sure it seems harmless, and you have probably gotten away with it for the past 10 years without anything happening. Still, chances are that it will happen someday.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fire is a simple thing. All you need is fuel, oxygen and heat. In a computer, there is some heat (which is hopefully kept down by the fans), and a lot of oxygen (also kindly fed by the fans). So now, all we need is a fuell. The steel casing isn't going to light up very soon, and generally the materials of the chips and bits aren't that flamable either. The wire insulation is most likely to catch fire. Or is it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Suppose your computer is an &amp;quot;allways on&amp;quot; fileserver, like mine. Only the disks spin down when it is not used for a long time, but everything else remains powered on. The fans of the system start to collect dust over the years, and are beginning to make more and more noise, and less and less revolutions. Before you know it, the dust is everywhere in your system, and the airflow is deminished to the sigh of a hamster, and the heat starts to build up. Dust is an excelent fuel, so all you have to do is get your marshmellows and wait for the fire to ignite&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personally, I don't like roasted marshmellows, or my house burning down. So I informed the users of the server, shut it down, and cleaned it, power supply and all. Not only is the computer (somewhat) less of a fire-hazard, the advantage is also that it has become slightly less noisy.
So be honest with me, which of you readers work for a company which actually has a policy for shutting down and cleaning servers in the server room? Or a dust-free server room? I don't think there are that much, but it would be something to think about with all these heat-generating machines in a single well-ventilated room...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wikipedia is not the truth!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/12/13/wikipedia-is-not-the-truth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2005 21:18:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/12/13/wikipedia-is-not-the-truth/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia&lt;/a> is not as good as you might think. Things written on Wikipedia are copied &amp;quot;verbatim&amp;quot; by other sites. By the time somebody checks the wikipedia story, he finds the verbatim copies and sees them as confirmation of the wikipedia story. And so the story stays on Wikipedia, spreading wrong ideas to schools, teachers, and you and I.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Spreading wrong information on the internet can have very big consequences, and &lt;a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm">John Seigenthaler knows this by personal experience&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->This is a typical case where the many good people suffer from the few rotten apples out there. Since Wikipedia is usually editted by the same people (although a large group), I think a simple, non-intrusive useraccount system would be the answer to these problems. Anonymous internet access is good, but when you write something about someone, I believe in the "open visor". If you write about a real person (with first and lastname), you should sign with your own real name (or at least be traceable). If you write about an alias, you should sign with your oen alias on that same system (or at least be traceable).
&lt;p>If the person who wrote the wikipedia article had done this, this whole situation could have been stopped soon. Maybe the writer didn't even do this on purpouse, but just got the wrong information. He could be contacted, the article could be corrected, and we all would have learned from it without too much harm done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, to all writers out there, be careful, because these days people still think that &amp;quot;what is printed (on screen) is the truth&amp;quot;. And certainly on the Internet, alas that is not the case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And yes, even on this blog I can make mistakes. But unlike wikipedia, my posts are traceable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Brilliant Fluids</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/31/brilliant-fluids/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 11:54:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/31/brilliant-fluids/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_img_3395.jpg">&lt;img src="r_img_3395.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Patience has paid off! In stead of stripping the front fender from the &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2005/10/19/terrible-italeri-decals/">terrible italeri decals&lt;/a>, I left it as is, and started searching the web for solutions. I read some brilliant tips on the forms at &lt;a href="http://www.modelbrouwers.nl/">www.modelbrouwes.nl&lt;/a>, and went to the &lt;a href="http://www.degroottoyspecialstore.nl/">local model shop&lt;/a> and bought some Microscale SET and SOL decal solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/gallery/image/42690.aspx"> &lt;/a>Actually, de bottle labled &amp;quot;SOL&amp;quot; proved to be the most useful. After you applied the decal, and it is all dry (like my carbon fender struts), you gently apply the SOL fluid to the decal with a soft brush. As you may have guessed, SOL stands for &amp;quot;solution&amp;quot; and that's what it does, it dissolves the decal slightly. The decal becomes so soft you can push and stretch it with the soft brush. Don't overdo it, if the decal won't go any further just let it dry, and try again tommorow. Sometimes it takes 2 to 3 tries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="r_img_3399.jpg">&lt;img src="r_img_3399.jpg?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a>The funny thing is that when the SOL fluid is applied, your decal may start to wrinkle. Ignore this. Just let it dry for a few hours (don't touch it!) and it will straighten out. Really great stuf!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The SET fluid smells like vinigar, and you are supposed to apply it to the model before you put the decal on. I have tried it, but I haven't seen the benefits of it yet. Maybe the SET fluid de-greases the surface a bit, but since I keep the surfaces clean anyway, it won't do much for me I guess. I have a lot more twisty and lumpy carbon parts to do, so maybe I'll get back at this...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Exhausts Airbrushed</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/25/exhausts-airbrushed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2005 12:01:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/25/exhausts-airbrushed/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3383_welds.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3383_welds.jpg?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a> After a lot of &lt;a href="o_img_3372.jpg">masking&lt;/a>, lot of &lt;a href="o_img_3382.jpg">paint-mixing&lt;/a>, and very little airbrushing, this is the result of my airbrush adventure to make the exhaust pipes look more realistic. I smuggled a bit, because normally exhausts are welded out of several bended pipes, to get the desired curve. The welds are allways on a spot where two bends meet. In this case, the welds are on random positions, and because I don't have a very acurate airbrush (rigid needle), they are seperated a bit more than normally. By doing it like this I can make the 3 gradients I wanted from metal to dark bronze-like oxidated metal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It may be not competely realistic, but it sure beats my normal pencil-only paintjobs! For the observant reader: Yes, that's another yucki Italeri decal on the engine side cover which is supposed to look like a carbon part with slots in it. The thick Italery decal can not follow the detail of the slots. I still haven't got the micro set fluid which could solve this (from hear-say). More on that later this week I guess, when I have time to stop by the local modelling shop to see if they have it in store.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also notice that it seems to be harder to get the larger models more realistic. Small models are easier because at some point, you simply can't add more detail, and it will look good. I built my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2005/10/16/ducati-desmodesi-supersport/">first ducati&lt;/a> in less time, without an airbrush, and it looks quite nice. I think I'll stick with the smaller models from now on. Shorter build time, takes up less storage space, are (very) cheap and fun to do.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Terrible Italeri Decals</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/19/terrible-italeri-decals/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Oct 2005 12:04:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/19/terrible-italeri-decals/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3378.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3378.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>So here I am, building my &lt;a href="o_img_3380.jpg">Ducati Monster S4 Fogerty 1:9 scale model&lt;/a>, and I discover that the decals that are contained in the kit are pretty worthless. After 30 minutes of fiddling with the decal, the results of the carbon fender supports is terrible. As you can see on the left. Please note that the fender is about 5 centimeters long, so the decal does not have to fold in tight bends to cover the fender support. Right now I am leaving it at this, and wil try to get my hands on some &lt;a href="http://shop.modelbrouwers.nl/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/414">Microscale Micro Set&lt;/a> to see if I can make the decal soft enough to do what I want. If not, I'll just paint all the carbon parts with semi-glos black. Maybe it will not be realistic, but at least it looks better than the strangely wrinkled carbon stickers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Airbrushing is becomming easier every day. The gloss paints are really comming out right, despite some small dust particles which allways show up when you don't need them. I have no plans on polishing the paint as some perfectionists do, it looks way better than using a brush to smear paint into the detailing of the parts. I'll just place this model next to a hand-painted one for the contrast ;-).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent the rest of the evening masking up the engine parts with masking tape to be able to make the exhaust pipes a slightly darker color. I will try to make the pipes darker at the cilinders, slightly changing to a lighter metal color on the colder parts. Maybe I'll even manage to get the welding joints looking realistic, who knows. It's a lot of work, masking the engine, exhaust pipes and welding joints in the pipes took me more than 2 hours. I'll paint them in probably 4 different colors, so it will take some time before the engine parts are finished.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ducati Desmodesi Supersport</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/16/ducati-desmodesi-supersport/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Oct 2005 12:13:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/10/16/ducati-desmodesi-supersport/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3368.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3368.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>A few weeks ago I completed a small model of a Ducati race bike. I did do some modelling some years ago, but it gradualy lost my interest. Then, a friend of mine came along and brought this small model of a motobike because I just got my motorbike driverslicense. He didn't expect I'd really build it, but I did, and I think the result is pretty decent, considering it's size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_3195.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_3195.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>And yes, it was really a model. Here you can see some parts during the build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really got the taste building bikes, so I bought a 1:9 scale Italeri model of a Ducati Monster S4 Fogerty. I will upload images during the build in the next few days/weeks. I also found my old airbrush, and made an adapter to connect it to my compressor. The compressor has a 24 liters airtank, and a pressure reducing device so I can make the pressure going into the brush between 1 and 8 bar. It really works great, and I have allready painted the frame, the tank and the engine of the Ducati Monster with it. More pictures to come!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_airbrush-adapter-1.gif">&lt;/a>Here is a picture of the adapter. On the right, there is a large (1/4&amp;quot;) connector to connect the compressor airhose to. On the left, there is a small connector to which a Badger or Revell airhose can be connected which leads to the airbrush. I got the small connector by destroying the Badger aircan connector.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lately, I've been collecting race circuit locations using &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth&lt;/a>. It's really nice to see the sometimes very detailed satelite images of race circuits. You can actually see the seperate kerbstone blocks of silverstone, and see how many cars there were parked at the time the picture was taken. You should try it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What really started to catch my interest is the fact that the maps of circuits as they are used in logo's or (worse) &amp;quot;how to get there&amp;quot;-maps are almost never of the &amp;quot;north pointing up&amp;quot; type. An example:
The circuit &amp;quot;Road America&amp;quot;, which is located a few miles north-east of Atlanta, Georgia, has a &lt;a href="http://www.roadatlanta.com/trackmap.lasso">web-site&lt;/a> which shows you a detailed map of the circuit, as well as pointers to the nearest highways. I have grabbed an image (because they only have these stupid noise making flash movie thingied nobody is interersted in after the second visit). It looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_road-atlanta.gif">&lt;img src="o_road-atlanta.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in my quest to find this circuit using Google Earth, I found the circuit to be along the 53, halfway from the I85 to the I985, just like the directions stated. But, the circuit seemed to be &amp;quot;turned around:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_road-atlanta-google.gif">&lt;img src="o_road-atlanta-google.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have noticed this with a lot of ciruits. I understand the need of turning and simplifying the circuit to make a nice logo, but when the circuit is depicted next to driving directions, I would make the map &amp;quot;north side up&amp;quot; so nobody gets confused. In the first image, the I85 apears to be west of the circuit, while it is actually east of the circuit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google Earth location of Road America (so you can check for yourselves):&lt;/p>

&lt;p>People who have read my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2005/07/01/ibatis-and-timestamps/">last post&lt;/a> are now probably removing the Date classes from their beans, replacing the code with things as new Long(new Date.getTime()) and such. This is also what I started doing, until a collegue of mine pointed out that the TypeHandler I wrote last saturday could also do the trick. This would mean my beans could still contain clean Dates. I was so close, and failed to realize that I (or ibatis) had that power.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I set out to do this and it works wonderfully. What I did was the following. I changes all postgres timestamp fields to bigints, like you read yesterday. I left my beans unchanged, containing java.util.Date objects for representing dates. So now all we need to do is write a typehandler which converts the date to a long and back, so Postgress and the buggy JDBC driver don't realize it's actually a Date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To do this I wrote the following TypeHandler:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>public class DateTypeHandler
implements TypeHandlerCallback {
public void setParameter(ParameterSetter setter,
Object parameter)
throws SQLException {
if (parameter == null) {
setter.setNull(Types.BIGINT);
} else {
Date datetime = (Date) parameter;
setter.setLong(datetime.getTime());
}
}
public Object getResult(ResultGetter getter)
throws SQLException {
long millis = getter.getLong();
if (getter.wasNull()) {
return null;
}
return new Date(millis);
}
public Object valueOf(String s) {
return s;
}
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now, all we need to do is tell ibatis to use this typehandler whenever we try to insert or retreive a java.util.Date. We do this by adding the following line to the ibatis SqlMapConfig.xml file, just after the typealias definitions:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;typeHandler javaType=&amp;quot;java.util.Date&amp;quot;
callback=&amp;quot;com.bestlaps.database.typehandlers.DateTypeHandler&amp;quot;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After doing this, you can cary on doing things as normal. Beans can contain java.util.Date, and ibatis happily inserts and retreives them in postgres bigint columns without any timezone conversion. Please note that timezones are not stored at all here, so when you retreive a Date from the database, the java.util.Date object will have your local JVM's devault timesone offset. You can happily ignore this, especially if you're not going to do any calculations with it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beauty of this solution is, that when there is a solution for the silly timezone conversion problem/bug, we can simply convert all database fields to timestamps, and remove the typehandler reference from the SqlMapConfig.xml file, and you're all set without changing a single line of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks Joris!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ibatis and Timestamps</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/07/01/ibatis-and-timestamps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jul 2005 13:05:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/07/01/ibatis-and-timestamps/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I am using Ibatis and PostgreSQL for this great project, &lt;a href="http://www.bestlaps.com/">www.bestlaps.com&lt;/a>. However, we've recently ran into a strange problem where we store a java.util.Date into a postgress TIMEZONE column, which works fine. However, when you want to retreive it, Ibatis returns a &amp;quot;StringIndexOutofBoundsException&amp;quot; at position 23. For some reason, the result returned by Postgres can not be converted back into a java.util.Date.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've tried really hard to circumvent this problem with custom setter methods (parsing the results myself), and using jodatime (a great java date and time replacement library). The fix is as simple as it is strange: Make Ibatis convert the timestamp into a java.&lt;strong>sql&lt;/strong>.Date, without changing your code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So: You have your normal bean, in which you use java.&lt;strong>util&lt;/strong>.Date. Then, make your Ibatis sqlMap as usual, but for the timestamp column you put the following in the resultmap: javaType=&amp;quot;java.&lt;strong>sql&lt;/strong>.Date&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strange, but it works for now. Maybe more info on this later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>UPDATE&lt;/strong>: Okay, after spending the whole weekend with this problem I discovered that the trick I just described does noet work. java.sql.Date has no time component, so when you retreive it, your java.util.Date in the bean will have a 00:00 time. So I had to search a bit further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When querying with SquirrelSQL, I can insert and retreive a timestamp to and from Postgress without it being changed. So it seems that it is no Postgress bug. When I am using Ibatis to insert a java.util.Date into Postgress, it gets &amp;quot;timezone corrected&amp;quot;, although I specifically told Postgress to store timestamps without timezones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The time gets corrected by 2 hours. This seems to come from the util.Date class, which seems to have a default offset of -120 minutes, although I did not set that, and did not request any timezone to be set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to make my own typeHandler for Ibatis, where I could convert the java.util.Date to a java.sql.TimeStamp, and give it directly to the PreparedStatement. But even that did not help. I am guessing the bug is in the Postgress JDBC driver, although that conflicts with the fact that SquirelSQL (which is als a Java/JDBC program) can do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>THE FIX&lt;/strong>: After more than 16 hours (!) of research I decided I would go for the workaround. We are behind schedule allready for the &lt;a href="http://www.bestlaps.com/">www.bestlaps.com&lt;/a> project, so I needed a quick fix. The way to go was dissapointingly simple: Convert Date's to Longs (with getTime()) and store the Longs in the database as number. This way ibatis and postgress don't know that it's a time. Pay attention to the fact that you need a postgress BIGINT to store the large number of milliseconds since the epoch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Final thoughts: **It seems that people who do not know how to handle timezones have built code to handle timezones. For Java, Postgres, Ibatis, or somewhere around that neighbourhood. Oh well, we knew that Java doesn't have a great Date system. A promising solution I found (but not used yet) is &lt;a href="http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=32005">JodaTime&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really hope the bug gets fixed soon so I can have proper dates in the database when we go live. For now, Longs work (and will probably stay in to the end of time).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dodenherdenking</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/05/04/dodenherdenking/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 May 2005 13:12:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2005/05/04/dodenherdenking/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Ben ik nou gek, of word dodenherdenking tegenwoordig een beetje &amp;quot;afgeraffeld&amp;quot;? Iedere Nederlander zou toch moeten weten hoe belangrijk het herdenken van de tweede wereld oorlog is (en zou moeten blijven). Toch lijkt het erop dat er steeds meer gemorreld wordt aan de gedachte, en de uitvoering van de herdenking zelf.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Tegenwoordig word er niet alleen aan de oorlog, maar ook aan allerlei andere zaken gedacht bij de herdenking. Dat vertroebeld volgens mij de echte kern van de herdenking. De tweede wereldorlog is een duidelijk beeld, wat goed uit te leggen is aan onze kinderen, en staat symbool voor alle slechte dingen en ideeen die we nu niet meer willen hebben. Als iets ergens "symbool" voor staat hoef je niet een lijst met bijzaken aan te halen. Als je dat moet doen, moeten misschien scholen en media meer aandacht gaan geven aan het begrip "symbool". Mensen mogen echt zelf ook nog wel denkruimte hebben, we hoeven niet alles voor te kauwen (zoals op TV, zucht).
&lt;p>Door een waslijst bij te gaan houden waar de dodenherdenking allemaal voor staat, word het idee en de uitstraling wat mij betreft een stuk minder krachtig, en een stuk minder makkelijk uit te leggen aan de nieuwe generatie(s).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dat &amp;quot;minder belangrijk&amp;quot; merken we nu al. De muziek die vandaag is gespeeld had af en toe weg van iets wat niet zou misstaan in een vrolijke circusvoorstelling, of een spannende aflevering van StarTrek. Ik vind het jammer dat deze muziek duidelijk niet is getoetsd aan de gepaste stemming die er in mijn ogen zou moeten heersen op een dergelijk moment. Het hele jaar door hebben we tijd zat om allerlei vrolijke dingen te doen. Dat is ook waarom we de doden herdenken, en daarna bevrijdingsdag vieren. Op bevrijdings dag hebben we vrij. Dan vind ik ook dat je 1x per jaar het fatsoen moet kunnen opbrengen om een keertje stil te staan bij de gevallenen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Misschien wel het ergste voorbeeld geven de commerciele (Nederlandse!) omroepen. Zij passen de programmering er niet voor aan, na de herdenking (2 seconden na de stilte ongeveer) word de knop weer teruggezet en vallen we midden in een vrolijke aflevering van &amp;quot;Friends!&amp;quot;. Dat kan toch niet de bedoeling zijn van een herdenking?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gelukkig kon ik op Nederland 2 wel verder kijken. Wat trouwens opviel is dat tijdens de 2 minuten stilte de microfoons open bleven staan, waardoor er allerlei geluiden hoorbaar waren. Kan zo'n regiseur niet even de geluidsknop dichtdraaien om ervoor te zorgen dat het ECHT stil is, en even letten op de monitor waarop hij kan zien dat het Wilhelmus word ingezet om vervolgens de schuif weer open te draaien? Ik vond het erg knullig overkomen, luide geluiden van paardgetrappel (o.i.d.) en het huilen van een mevrouw die dicht bij de microfoon stond.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>En dan wijst de commentator er even fijntjes op dat alleen mensen met de Nederlandse nationaliteit kransen mogen leggen. Vlak daarna zien we 60 kinderen een bloemetje leggen die duidelijk niet van Nederlandse afkomst zijn. Hebben we dan niet weer juist die scheiding gemaakt? Zouden we na de oorlog niet juist geen verschil mogen maken tussen ras, afkomst of nationaliteit? De wereld heeft verdomme 5 jaar oorlog gehad met mensen die zo dachten, het maakt toch niet uit wie er een krans legt, als het maar met de juiste gedachte, bedoelingen en respect gaat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ik hoop dat sommige mensen eens naar een videobandje van wat oudere herdenkingen gaan kijken, daarvan leren en iets meer aandacht gaan spenderen aan de volgende herdenking. Misschien wel net zoveel aandacht als er gegeven word aan de mooie kleurige ragscherpe reclames in dolby surround met perfecte timing. Kom op jongens, het is niet ingewikkeld. Nee het is allemaal niet leuk, en we verdienen er vast geen geld mee, maar het hoort er wel bij. En als je het niet kunt, moet je het iemand laten doen die wel dat respect en geduld kan opbrengen. En nee, ik ben niet ouder dan 80, zelfs niet ouder dan 40. Mijn ouders hebben mij waarschijnlijk iets geleerd wat tegenwoordig niet meer in moderne woordenboeken past, of waarvan de spelling dermate is veranderd dat zelfs de betekenis verloren is gegaan.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maargoed, ik zal niet te lang zeuren, want dan verpest ik jullie vrije dag nog, die ongetwijfeld wel in de juiste steming word doorgebracht, nadat je waarschijnlijk met de koffers in de caravan stond te hannesen om 8 uur, of zelfs al onderweg was met de kids luidruchtig en onwetend op de achterbank. Want ja, prioriteiten moeten er zijn natuurlijk he. Trompetles is er denk ik 1 van.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_2708.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_2708.jpg?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a> Today I found the first good use for the milling machine. I had this cast aluminum housing for an electronics project, with ridges on the inside. I made a hole for a connector in it, but I never got the nut on the inside flat to the surface because of the ridges on the inside of the housing. I decided to use the mill to flatten the surface on the inside of the housing. The housing did not fit in the clamp, so I had to find a way to get it attached to the bed of the mill in a different way. I took a piece of wood, drilled two holes in it and bolted that to the bed of the mill. Then, I used long plywood screws and another piece of wood to hold the housing. In the picture on the right you can see this construction. I used a test indicator to align the house to the X-axis of the bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_2710.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_2710.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Since I only needed a plane large enough to place a ring and nut on, I roughly adjusted the 6mm mill to just not touch the bottom of the housing. I milled down to the point where the ridges were not visible. The image on the left is the result of the work. The mill is a very nice tool to adjust ready-made electronics housing to your likings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Miling machine</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/2004/11/07/miling-machine/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2004 18:36:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/2004/11/07/miling-machine/</guid><description>

Yes, that's right. That's a mill you're looking at. And yes, that photo was taken at my workshop. Last week I took a couple of days off from work, and decided to do another workshop upgrade session. After buying some decent wrenching tools, I spent some hours on the web looking for a nice bench drill. I was thinking of buying a cheap mill later on, but I found a nice combination of the two at the &lt;a href="http://www.locloods.demon.nl/">locloods&lt;/a>. This small mill, the HMD Black &amp;amp; Red X1-super, is a nice hybrid. It operates like a bench drill, but when the handle is locked, you can use the wheels to precisely control X and Y movement of the working piece and Z movement of the mill.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://blogger.xs4all.nl//images/blogger_xs4all_nl/rrolfje/4030/t_IMG_2704.jpg" alt="Milling Machine">
I made a nice sturdy table for the mill to rest on and bolted it on. It was a bit hard to get the mill on the high table, because it weighs about 45 kilograms and it's really hard to grab on to. I've put a piece of white MDF board on the wall to hold the tools that go with the mill. Putting pieces of wood against the wall to hold tools is terrific. I've also done this with the tools for my lathe, see the zundapp image gallery for more pictures of the workshop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What was once a gray and dark place to just park a car in, is now almost a solarium with lots of tools. There's still a lot of work to be done to get the workshop completely ready, and I wonder if it will ever be finished, but it's becomming more practical every day.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a> Today I picked up my old moped at my parents house. Yes, that's right, I'm 33 and I still have my very first moped. It's a real special one. I belonged to my grandfather, who passed it on to my nephew, who passed it on to me when I turned 15. When I got it it needed a lot of work. I spent some months taking it completely apart with my dad. We didn't have a workshop back then, so we took it apart in the kitchen, of my parent's apartment on the 7th floor :-)When I turned 16 it was ready and better than new. It was really cool to have a classic Zundapp CS50. At that time, it looked like a motorbike next to my friend's puchs and peugeots. It really was a dream to ride, you could sit for hours on it without getting tired. I drove it for a good 6 years before it went in to &amp;quot;hibernation&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/images/blogger_xs4all_nl/rrolfje/4015/t_IMG_2371.JPG" alt="">
So, having my own home and my own workshop right now, I decided it was a good time to pick it up and make it run once again. These German mopeds are made to last, I can tell you. When I get it running again I am sure it will be able to run for at least another 20 years or so, provided it gets reasonable maintenance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>History, Sony Online Drama&lt;/strong>
I bought a Sony PS2 a few years ago, when it just got out. I beleive it belongs to the first or second batch of Playstation 2 consoles arriving in the Netherlands. It costed a small fortune. About a year later, I purchased the Linux kit for my PS2. The Linux kit came with a network adapter and a harddisk. It worked like a charm. Sony had not started the online game service back then.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When Sony finally announced their network gaming plans, the Linux for Playstation group very kindly sent me a &amp;quot;Network Access Disc&amp;quot;. This is the disc you normally get when purchasing your network adapter for the PS2. However, being an early version and all, I never got it working properly. I spent hours (no, literally!) trying to register my handle and username. I never got it working properly. Friends of mine who bought the official adapter had newer versions of the software, which seemed to work better but still not good enough.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The beautiful world of non-Sony developers&lt;/strong>
I had given up on online gaming on the PS2 by now. A few months ago I played an online demo of DTM race driver 2 on my PC, and had great fun. I registered with GameSpy and was online and gaming with my friends in less than 5 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last weekend, I found a copy of DTM2 for the PS2. Since I liked the fysics engine of DTM2 for the PS2, I decided to give it a try. Not even thinking about the cruddy PS2 online gaming option. When I got home and started the game, I was pleasantly surprised to see that DTM2 for PS2 actually uses the GameSpy system in stead ot the stupid Sony stuff. Again, I was playing online in within 5 minutes (had to look up my old GameSpy Id). I even hooked up an USB keyboard, which made logging in even simpler! Terrific!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My compliments to Codemasters and Gamespy, who have restored my hope and ability to play online games with my PS2.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
