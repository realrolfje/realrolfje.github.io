&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/BweBCNBxJxM">&lt;img src="keychain-mac-tuto.png" alt="keychain-mac-tuto">
&lt;/a>If you used DSA keys to log in to your SSH server and have upgraded your client machine to macOS Sierra (or OSX Sierra if you like), you probably ran into this problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh -p 8123 &lt;a href="mailto:george@10.0.0.10">george@10.0.0.10&lt;/a> -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa
Permission denied (publickey).
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The answer to this problem is replacing the DSA key with an RSA key, but how do you do on the server when your only means for connecting is the OSX client machine you just upgraded? Here's how:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First, create a new 4096 bit RSA keypair on the local machine (don't delete your DSA keys yet!). Don't use anything less than 4096 bits, and protect it with a lengthy passphrase. This key will replace the DSA key later on.
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:OA3Vx8qb4kKRWYs8qsq5/EywaLLdwZdlCIITFPnRtt8 &lt;a href="mailto:george@macbook.local">george@macbook.local&lt;/a>
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 4096]----+
|ooo . .. . |
| + . o .. . o |
|o o +.o= o o |
| . o oB=. o |
| . .=oS o |
|. o.. .&lt;em>.Eo |
|oo oo.o. . |
|=o=. o. . |
|o&lt;/em>+o. . |
+----[SHA256]-----+
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don't worry about that long passphrase, Sierra now &lt;a href="https://personalresearchblog.wordpress.com/2016/09/28/macos-sierra-ssh-key-passphrase-and-the-keychain/">stores that in your Keychain&lt;/a>. Now, log into your server by temporarily enabling ssh-dss public key support on the ssh command line, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh -p 8123 &lt;a href="mailto:george@10.0.0.10">george@10.0.0.10&lt;/a> -i ~/.ssh/id_dsa &lt;br>
-o PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-dss
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If all went well, you should now be connected to your server, but with your old DSA key. The DSA support was disabled in Sierra because it is &lt;a href="https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/5096/rsa-vs-dsa-for-ssh-authentication-keys#5100">no longer considered to be a safe option&lt;/a> as it is based on the discrete logarithm problem and the key is required to be just 1024 bits long.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we need to do now is remove the DSA public key from the server and add the newly created RSA key. Start your editor with:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
server$ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find the old DSA public key, remove it. Add the contents of the &lt;code>id_rsa.pub&lt;/code> on your client machine to this file on the server. Save the file with &lt;code>&amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;:wq&amp;lt;enter&amp;gt;&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now exit the server and reconnect with your new RSA key from the client:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
server$ exit
client$ ssh -p 8123 &lt;a href="mailto:george@10.0.0.10">george@10.0.0.10&lt;/a> -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You should now see the welcome message from the server and the command prompt. Please note that the -i option is here for clarity; if your key is in &lt;code>~/.ssh/id_rsa&lt;/code> it will be used as default identity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If everything worked, please delete the id_dsa key to prevent confusion. All operations should now be back to normal (but safer).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus 1: Tab-completion for SSH&lt;/strong>
If you are tired of typing the long ssh commands and remembering ip addresses and key files, create a file called &lt;code>~/.ssh/config&lt;/code> and give it the following contents:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-super-secret-server">My Super secret server&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Host secret-server
HostName 10.0.0.1
Port 8123
User george
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After saving the file, you can use tab completion after the ssh command, and you will notice that the following command will work:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]
client$ ssh secret-server
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus 2: Per-server identity&lt;/strong>
With the powers of the config file mentioned earlier, there is no longer a reason to have one key file or one userid per server. Suppose somebody accidentally gets a hold of a key file, or someone figures out a way to find a key for a bunch of packets between two machines. This would mean immediate compromise of all machines. Because there is no extra effort in using multiple keys, I use a new private key for each server. My &lt;code>~/.ssh/config&lt;/code> file looks similar to this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; gutter=&amp;quot;false&amp;quot;]&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="my-super-secret-server-1">My Super secret server&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Host secret-server
HostName 10.0.0.1
Port 8123
User george
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_george_secret_rsa&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-dmz-firewall">The DMZ firewall&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Host dmz-firewall
HostName 10.0.0.21
Port 8623
User jack
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_jack_dmz_fw_rsa
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because just like passwords, I never use the same private key twice.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From the Finder to the Shell (and back)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2013/12/20/from-the-finder-to-the-shell-and-back/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:10:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2013/12/20/from-the-finder-to-the-shell-and-back/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A quick tip for OSX users out there who frequently need to open a Terminal window for the current location in the finder, or the other way around:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="open-folder.png" alt="Go2Shell and Back">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Install the free application from the App Store: &lt;a href="https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/go2shell/id445770608?l=en&amp;amp;mt=12">Go2Shell&lt;/a>. It will give you an icon on the toolbar of your Finder, and pressing it will open a Terminal window and automatically change it's directory to match the Finder's location.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other way around is easier; you can already do that on any Mac. Simply type &amp;quot;open .&amp;quot; (that's the word &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;, followed by a space and a period). This command will open a Finder window for the directory location your Terminal window is in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus tip:&lt;/strong> Also check the &amp;quot;open -t [filename]&amp;quot; command, it will open your system's default text editor with the given file.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iOS7 hidden features</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2013/09/28/ios7-hidden-features/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Sep 2013 21:03:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2013/09/28/ios7-hidden-features/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS4xIrTYDWU">&lt;img src="ios-7-logo.png" alt="ios-7-logo">
&lt;/a>If you've just installed iOS7 and like it as much as I do, you are probably interested in all the new features of it, and where to find them. On behalf of Apple, I'll be happy to point out where all those neat new features are, and share my happiness about this wonderful new magical market-leading mobile OS.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Easy-Steal (tm)**
&lt;p>**&lt;a href="easy-steal-e284a2.png">&lt;img src="easy-steal-e284a2.png?w=113" alt="Easy-Steal (™)">
&lt;/a>**Remember how in iOS6, you can not just steal an iphone because of the &amp;quot;find my iPhone&amp;quot; feature? Thieves had to put your iPhone in a metal container so it could not tell the owner where it is. Because thieves are people too, we now introduced &amp;quot;Easy-Steal (tm)&amp;quot;. When a thief wants to steal your phone, all he has to do is swipe up, press the little airplane button, and nobody will hear from your iPhone again. Want to disable that? Easy. Hand over your flashlight, calculator, timer, and iPod controls.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Separate is the new Integrate&lt;/strong>
Remember how we beautifully integrated FaceTime with the Phone app? How Podcasts could be played from within iTunes? Well we think that's not the future. So we created a separate FaceTime app, and a separate Podcasts app. So you can have more icons on more screens, making it harder to find stuff. We'll let you in on a little secret. Our next big thing? A Separate device for each function. It will be great! You can just take the device you need and leave all the other ones charging on your desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New sounds. And Old Classic ones.&lt;/strong>
Remember how software developers always say you should not use terms as &amp;quot;Old&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Classic&amp;quot; in your software because putting a &amp;quot;New&amp;quot; sticker on a banana will not prevent it from going stale? Well we're not so sure about that. So now, in the old (sorry, new) sound settings, you will find all the same behavior of the old settings, but with new sounds. We've even changed all the sounds your phone makes right from the upgrade. If you would like to revert to the old sounds, don't bother searching in the sounds list. Scroll through the &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; list. You know, because on the first screen, there is a list of sounds, and in the second list, there will be... err... a list of sounds. But old. Get it? Did we say it was completely new? We lied. Sorry.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Camouflage&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="icon-rainbow.png">&lt;img src="icon-rainbow.png" alt="icon rainbow">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All icons are now devoid of those pesky shading and lining that made them visible on all backgrounds. So now, no matter what background color you use, there will always be at least one icon which will blend into the background. We even removed the shading on the text, so you can make that disappear with a simple white background. And did you notice the gradients? Some are light-to-dark, and some are dark-to-light. Why? Because at the new Apple, we hate consistency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Square.&lt;/strong>
A new picture mode. Because you want to make photos. videos, and... err... squares?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Look-at-Me (tm)&lt;/strong>
To make the phone look faster, we made the icons zoom and pan to show how the operating systems moves to help you complete your tasks. It was tested on 500 Dwarf Hamsters and we are pretty sure we made a good job of making people look at your screen while you're using your phone. At least half of those people will get &lt;a href="http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/44165/how-do-i-prevent-motion-sickness-when-using-ios-7/">motion sickness within 15 seconds&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New Applications&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="new-apps.png">&lt;img src="new-apps.png" alt="New Apps">
&lt;/a>
The seasoned iOS6 user will have immediately spotted it: We've got new Applications! Get more accurate timing in your iPhone with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourbillon">Tourbillon&lt;/a> app. Make your own weather predictions with the Barometer app, and create stunning graphics with the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Mandelbrot&lt;/a> app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>New Puzzles&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>_&lt;a href="clickable-puzzle.png">&lt;img src="clickable-puzzle.png?w=450" alt="Clickable Puzzle">
&lt;/a>_&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now have hours of fun trying to figure out what is tappable or slidable. Is it the text? Is it the color? Is it the icons? Who knows? We've put great care in removing all visual clues, so start taping and sliding!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The update process has also become more fun. Because we love our non-US iPhone users, we've made the &amp;quot;Purchased&amp;quot; icon a letter &amp;quot;P&amp;quot;. Level up! The dark arrow pointing down ads to the fun when you tap it and... it slides to the left, which reveals your purchases to the right.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="updates-puzzle.png">&lt;img src="updates-puzzle.png" alt="Updates Puzzle">
&lt;/a>And did we say one update? We'll list all the past updates too, so you can have more useless info on the screen. For good measure, we even added fun blue dots next to the updated apps you did not open already. How useful is that?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="installing.png">&lt;img src="installing.png" alt="Installing..">
&lt;/a>Progress indicators are now even more fun. During updates, your app is named &amp;quot;Installing...&amp;quot; Can you guess what this icon is? If you guessed the application was updating, can you tell if it is at 25% or 75%?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the real advanced puzzlers, we've hidden some controls. Can you make the &amp;quot;Today&amp;quot; widget just display your calendar item without-arbitrary-text-around-it-which-makes-your-content-harder-to-view-at-a-glance? Can you slide your &amp;quot;Stock Options&amp;quot; widget below the &amp;quot;Tomorrow&amp;quot; widget?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="message-center-puzzle.png">&lt;img src="message-center-puzzle.png?w=169" alt="Message Center Puzzle">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A new lock screen&lt;/strong>
People like lock screens. So they can put functions on them for which you don't have to unlock. Smart, right? Now, people can start playing with your phone without unlocking it, weather you like it or not. Because there is no option to disable that. To make everything easier, we've put more icons on the lock screen, making gestures more finicky. Because we know what &lt;del>Android&lt;/del> iPhone users like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="lockscreens.png">&lt;img src="lockscreens.png?w=450" alt="LockScreens">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>And 6789 more features&lt;/strong>
There is much more to discover. The camera app is on 2 locations in the home screen. The message center is as confusing and inconsistent as ever. The new &amp;quot;dots&amp;quot; signal strength indicator, the network operator name, the wifi icon and the new &amp;quot;gprs&amp;quot; icon are now even wider, so they'll never fit the top bar. Sliders switches look bulkier, slide less, but they do change colors as if they were a bulb. You decide what it's supposed to be, let your imagination run wild! A white dot? Is it a slider or just a dot? Who needs aluminum, Try it out!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you'll excuse us, we're going to sue Sony because they made their Xperia look like our market-leading mobile OS. See?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ios7-because-when-you-paid-for-an-iphone-we-know-you-actually-wanted-android">&lt;strong>iOS7. Because when you paid for an iPhone, we know you actually wanted Android.&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>P.S.&lt;/strong> Jony, I'm not sure how much you're involved in the UI design, but if you need help, or a better sparring partner, or I need to come rescue you from the bozos that made you do this, the iPhone 5Cheap with it's non-right-angle old-school injection molded back and the gold iPhone, let me know. You're better than this, and maybe we can still fix things. You know how to contact me. Hang in there buddy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open letter to Keith Lang about Skitch</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2013/01/03/open-letter-to-keith-lang-about-skitch/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jan 2013 22:33:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2013/01/03/open-letter-to-keith-lang-about-skitch/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">&lt;img src="skitch_logo_lockup_blog.jpg" alt="Skitch 1.0.2">
&lt;/a>Dear Keith,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I read &lt;a href="http://blog.evernote.com/blog/2012/11/21/skitch-and-evernote-a-letter-from-keith-lang/">your letter&lt;/a> about Skitch and would like to respond to all that has happened from my end-user perspective.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a long-time Evernote user and fan. Evernote changed note taking by being truly searchable. I can confidently drop all the websites, receipts, todos and ideas in there, and clear my mind of the &amp;quot;I must remember that&amp;quot; burden. The OCR of Evernote works beautifully on photos of whiteboards, making even my whiteboard notes searchable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2010, I discovered Skitch. The simplicity and razor sharp focus on anotating a screencapture and share the anotated image by dragging it anywhere was sheer brilliance. My daily work includes making annotated screenhots and mailing them to team members to discuss improvements. Skitch changed this ugly capture-save-edit-save-attach-send cycle to pure poetry in motion. Dragging images into Evernote even made my screenshots searchable. It instantly became second nature and my go-to image tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->As a software developer, I know that software is rarely "finished". There is always that little bug to fix, that missing functionality to add, or some ugly code to refactor. But Skitch was different. It was perfect as it was. It integrated beautifully with everything in my Mac, including Evernote. Not tightly coupled to anything, yet integrated with everything. As a fellow software developer surely you must recognize the poetry in perfect decoupling like this.
&lt;p>When rumors reached me about Skitch being integrated into Evernote I was very worried. Why integrate Skitch into something? It already integrated beautifully with everything on my Mac. Why tie it to some product? I guess the answer is money. Evernote buying Skitch must have been a financially interesting, but I fully expected Skitch to degrade because of that deal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first release of Skitch in the Mac App store confirmed all my fears. Skitch 2.0 was so utterly broken, so alien to all users who used or saw Skitch 1.0 on my machine, so crippled, so devoid of it's original focus. Skitch 2.0 left me and some of my colleagues very dissapointed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily, my trusty Time Machine backup had the old version of Skitch and I quickly distributed it to all the poor users who installed Skitch from the Mac App store. But the damage was already done. Frustrated users, underground distribution of the old version of Skitch to a lucky few. To this day I have not figured out what the &amp;quot;advantage&amp;quot; of the &amp;quot;integration&amp;quot; with Evernote is. All blogs and open letters from Evernote and the Skitch team make excuses, link to the old Skitch 1.0.2, talk about how Skitch 2.0 is not Skitch 1.0, but fail to explain what the true advantage is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To me, &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">Skitch 1.0.2&lt;/a> is the version of Skitch that truly integrates with Evernote and every other application in a simple, consistent and easy to understand way. It made sharing easy and understandable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sellout to Evernote was the death of Skitch. Sure, some features were added back into Skitch 2.0.2, but only to make Skitch 2 into a cheap knockoff of the once great Skitch 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that Evernote has bought Skitch, sales people will want to integrate it into Evernote even more tightly, migrate it to all platforms, thereby losing some of the tight integration with the OS that made Skitch so wonderful and effortless. Even with all the Skitch 1.0 fans behind you, you will have to fight a board of directors who never used Skitch and want to change it without truly understanding why people loved the old Skitch. The gold handcuffs in your deal with Evernote will prevent you from restoring Skitch to what it was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I can only hope that somebody, somewhere realizes how brutally Skitch was butchered by people who clearly did not see the beauty and simplicity of Skitch's userinterface. I can only hope that this person has the skill, means or pure balls to bring the old Skitch back and release it to the Mac App store, maybe under a different name. Just the &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">Skitch 1.0.2&lt;/a>, as is. Screen capture, resize or crop, annotate, your history on the flip-side, and sharing/saving by dragging. Nothing more.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Meanwhile, I have Skitch 1.0.2 backed up in every location I can possibly think of. It is an invaluable addition to my daily workflow, and I dread the day Skitch 1.0.2 will no longer work with a new version of OSX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On behalf of all Skitch users out there, thanks for creating the truly amazing, one and only &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/download/get.php?file=SkitchMac_v1">Skitch 1.0.2&lt;/a>. Come over and talk to us. Bring your 1.0.2 sources. We have cookies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Make your buildserver talk</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2012/12/16/make-your-buildserver-talk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Dec 2012 16:52:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2012/12/16/make-your-buildserver-talk/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Today Steve Job's yacht was launched from a dock a few miles from my house. I went there with some friends and we shot some awesome footage of this incredible ship. Through the glass, we could see the 7 iMacs which are used to control the ship. There are also large doors on the side and the back, I suspect these will be used to launch boats or jetskis into a nice warm Mediterranean water.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->We were able to catch a glimpse of it's name on the stern: "Venus". Too bad Steve didn't get to enjoy this. I hope is family and friends have a great time aboard this ship.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QawYoignHI">&lt;img src="toyota-iphone-bluetooth.png" alt="Connect your iPhone to your Toyota's Bluetooth system">
&lt;/a>My sisters in law bought a beautiful 2006 Toyota Corolla Verso. They could not get the iPhone to pair with the car's Bluetooth system. The dealer told them that this was an iPhone problem, but after some fiddling, it turns out there is a simple workaround. If you want to pair an iPhone to your car, and the car says &amp;quot;pairing failed&amp;quot; as soon as you tap on your iPhone, this simple trick might help for you. This article contains detailed steps for the Toyota Corolla Verso, but on other cars this might work too.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * &amp;lt;!-- more --&amp;gt;Start the car (don't start driving), and take out your iPhone.
* On the iPhone, tap **&amp;quot;Settings&amp;quot;**, **&amp;quot;General&amp;quot;** and **&amp;quot;Bluetooth&amp;quot;**. Make sure Bluetooth is switched on. Leave the iPhone on this screen.
* Press and hold **&amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;** on the steering wheel of the car.
* When the car says &amp;quot;Setup Menu&amp;quot;, say **&amp;quot;Pair Phone&amp;quot;**
* On the iPhone, tap the **&amp;quot;TOYOTA&amp;quot;** network.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The car will almost immediately say &amp;quot;Pairing failed&amp;quot;. On your phone, the password prompt will show. Do not do anything, let the phone stay on this screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="interior-2008-toyota-corolla-verso-bourgas-pic-2-334.jpg">&lt;img src="interior-2008-toyota-corolla-verso-bourgas-pic-2-334.jpg" alt="Toyota Corolla Verso Dashboard">
&lt;/a>This is because the iPhone probably tries to connect with a default password like &amp;quot;0000&amp;quot;, the car immediately aborts, and doesn't allow a second try. The phone detects the connection failure and will popup a &amp;quot;password&amp;quot; screen for you to enter a number that does work, but the car has already given up. Not to worry, read on:&lt;/p>
&lt;p> &lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Press and hold **&amp;quot;mode&amp;quot;** on the steering wheel again.
* When the system says &amp;quot;Setup Menu&amp;quot;, say **&amp;quot;Pair Phone&amp;quot;**
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The car enters pairing mode for the second time. Because the phone is still in the &amp;quot;Password prompt&amp;quot; screen, it is already past the detection phase,  and will not try to send the default password. Now you can enter your password and the connection will succeed on the &amp;quot;first&amp;quot; try as seen from your car.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * With the iPhone still in the password screen, enter **&amp;quot;1234&amp;quot;** (or whatever password the car tells you) press **&amp;quot;Connect&amp;quot;**.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Congratulations, your phone is now paired.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to make customers blog about you</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2012/05/02/how-to-make-customers-blog-about-you/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 May 2012 21:59:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2012/05/02/how-to-make-customers-blog-about-you/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="laptopaccuslogo.png" alt="">
An informative article for webshop owners this time, all about how to make people blog about your company. Everything you need to know about online customers, the power of the internet, and how good old moral values still work and can be leveraged to your advantage. Or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->1. Create a website (or two)&lt;/strong>
The first step of every professional online webshop is ofcourse the webshop itself. It should give the customer a good feeling about your customer, and what better than to make the website in the customer's local language? Or, if you really want to go all the way, you can register different local domains, like Lawrence did when he registered &amp;quot;laptop-accus.nl&amp;quot;, and probably a bunch of other domains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2. Combine great presentation with low pricing&lt;/strong>
Create good looking product pages, which are easily linkable, and make it clear to the customer that this is the cheap knockoff, I mean, product he needs. To top it all off, offer your products at an almost unbelievably low price.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="a1175-product-page.png">&lt;img src="a1175-product-page.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>3. Put your company name on the payment receipt&lt;/strong>
When the customer chooses to purchase a product, make sure that your company name is on the receipt. Between all the payments on a credit card bill you want your company to stand out, or at least you want the customer to be able to easily check his payments. Clearly, the &amp;quot;hunt360&amp;quot; and the &amp;quot;GB&amp;quot; indicate that this payment is from the &amp;quot;laptop-accus.nl&amp;quot; shop. &lt;em>ahem&lt;/em> Also note the difference between advertized price and the receipt for added customer convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="visa-receipt.jpg">&lt;img src="visa-receipt.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>4. Use a professional looking email address&lt;/strong>
When people contact you for questions or support, your reply says a lot about your company, starting with the &amp;quot;reply to&amp;quot; address in your mail. In this case, Lawrence went all the way, and even used the word &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; in his email address for that extra &amp;quot;enterprise&amp;quot; touch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="initial-and-only-mail-from-lawrence-censored.png">&lt;img src="initial-and-only-mail-from-lawrence-censored.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>5. Hire the best shipping provider&lt;/strong>
So you made a local website. But to be able to make some profit, you found a cheap manufacturer in Singapore. So to get products from your manufacturer to the customer, preferably without stocking up, you select the absolute best parcel service you can find. For instance, you can select Swiss post to deliver your parcels, door to door, at an incredible speed:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="swisspost-tracking-cropped.png">&lt;img src="swisspost-tracking-cropped.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, you've read those dates correctly. Pretty awesome shipping speeds there. For a handicapped &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_snail">sea snail&lt;/a> traveling over land. And handicapped sea snails tend to get caught at the border, so your customers will always pay that extra import tax you never warned about on your site:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="import-tax.jpg">&lt;img src="import-tax.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6. Promptly answer customer mails&lt;/strong>
In the unfortunate circumstance that your customer is not as impressed with the shipping speeds as you are, make sure you answer questions politely promptly. During the shipping process I asked some questions about why it takes way longer than the advertised 10 days to get my battery, and I got exactly 0 (zero) responses. And I even used the &amp;quot;professional&amp;quot; email address! Nothing says &amp;quot;hey I've got your money, now beat it!&amp;quot; like ignoring paying customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>7. Let your products speak for themselves.&lt;/strong>
When the customer receives your product, it is your chance to shine. The product will prove itself to be a top-of-the-line knockoff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="nice-fit.jpg">&lt;img src="nice-fit.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this case you can clearly see how beautiful it fits the macbook, sitting &amp;quot;perfectly&amp;quot; flush with the body, having the exact same Aluminum color, and immediately is recognized as a brand new, fresh battery by the OS. (NOT, NOT and NOT).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="not-charging.png">&lt;img src="not-charging.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should you think this is not enough, you can add some extra pizzaz to the whole customer experience by leaving the original wholesale receipt in the box. It will tell the customer how much you paid for this cheap knockoff ($30 is €22,81).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="actual-wholesale-price.png">&lt;img src="actual-wholesale-price.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And if you are really the top of the line customer experience perfectionist, you can rig your battery to grow bulges. Is that a battery in your laptop or is it glad to see me?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="laptop-bulge-1.jpg">&lt;img src="laptop-bulge-1.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="laptop-bulge-2.jpg">&lt;img src="laptop-bulge-2.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>8. Have a money-back guarantee.&lt;/strong>
When the battery almost explodes, and the customer asks you about your money-back guarantee, politely ignore those mails, just as you did with the shipping inquiries. For good measure, make sure you filter out all messages from paying customers so you can focus on new ones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Recap:&lt;/strong>
This lengthy article is proof of the fact that you can, in fact, easily convince people to blog about your webshop. Use suspicious names on the receipts, make sure delivery takes weeks or months, ship the cheapest, crappiest products you can find, use a free gmail account to do customer service from, and well, actually, just simply don't do customer service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for my personal story: I have learned to not order the cheapest knockoff battery at some random shop because the price is too tempting. This dead battery arrived a month after ordering, and cost me €56,30 + €16,87 = &lt;strong>€73,17&lt;/strong> instead of the advertized €44,-.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although I did ask about the refund policy, I doubt I'll ever send this battery back, because I don't expect them to refund me, and I probably will have to pay for shipping, which means more loss. Let's just say that this is an just an expensive way to create material for my blog and helping you make the right buying decision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've ordered a proper battery at &lt;a href="http://store.apple.com/nl/product/MA348G/A">Apple&lt;/a> for &lt;strong>€139,-&lt;/strong> but this time I know there will be no extra charges, it will fit perfectly, and it will just work. Learn from this blogpost and please, please order the original battery from the original manufacturer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy shopping!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mortgage Awareness</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2012/04/01/mortgage-awareness/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Apr 2012 16:41:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2012/04/01/mortgage-awareness/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This weekend I tinkered around with Apple Keynote. I thought I'd make something useful. In this video I'm trying to show you how much money the bank makes on your mortgage. Banks like you to pay a low monthly fee on your mortgage because it keeps the loan higher for a longer period of time. This way the bank can cash in on the interest rate, and then cash in again at the end of the mortgage contract, when you are still hopelessly in debt.&lt;/p>
&lt;video width=100% controls autoplay>
&lt;source src="Mortgage Awareness with audio.m4v" type="video/mp4">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;Financial advisors&amp;quot; working for the bank will throw sand in your eyes, saying that keeping your debt high gives you all kinds of tax breaks. But in the end, it's them who get better of that construction, not you. Don't fall into this trap. Understand your mortgage contract, learn how the model works, and check your model against the bank's model (without that financial advisor or the lady at the helpdesk talking to you). You have more room than you think. Use it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Month view Redesign</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2011/10/14/month-view-redesign/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Oct 2011 21:35:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2011/10/14/month-view-redesign/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="weekcal-design-icon.png" alt="A day in my week">
True to their tradition on the Mac, the Calendar and Addressbook applications on the iPhone are, let's say &amp;quot;lacking finesse&amp;quot;. As good as Apple can design products and user interfaces, their focus is clearly not on calendars and address books. I've read somewhere that &amp;quot;iCal is proof that Steve does not maintain his own calendar&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After trying out various replacements on the iPhone, I finally stuck with a pretty darn good calendar for the iPhone called &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/week-calendar/id381059732?mt=8">&amp;quot;Week Calendar&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. The main reason for switching to that app is that it actually has a week view, but when I started using it more intensely I found myself using the month view the most. Until somebody at Apple stopped the show.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First of all, let me explain why I like Week Calendar's original month view by comparing it to the original iCal (these are actual screenshots from my actual phone):
&lt;p>&lt;img src="ical-vs-weekcal.png" alt="iCal vs WeekCal">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left, we see Apple's iCal. Apple places a dot on a day where I have appointments. This not very useful for people who have appointments on each day, as you can see. On the right, Week Calendar's colored dots tells me how many appointments I have, and in which Calendar they are (my green calendar is work, my red calendar is private).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other big improvements in Week Calendar's month view are more room for the events of the selected day, the week numbers on the left, the end times of appointments, and the little icons indicating recurring appointments and alarm settings. All huge usability improvements, clearly outperforming Apple's iCal. But suddenly the month view disappeared from Week Calendar. Many users of Week Calendar complained, and the response from UtiliTap was rather surprising:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>"Apple forced those changes upon us, since they have full control over your iPhone and over developers apps. They claim the Day and (old) Month views look to similar to theirs."&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Clearly, somebody at Apple had misinterpreted the rules, and broke a very useful application by using &amp;quot;the force&amp;quot; for no good reason. UtiliTap quickly came out with a release with no less than two month views, the Mini-Month view (which I don't like that much) and a replacement for the original month view.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The replacement month view is not as nice as the first one, and I find that it puts more strain on my eyes when I'm using it. I miss the old month view. I had a whole blogpost ready with a rant about how Apple would now have to sue each Calendar maker in the world because their month view looks too much like Apple's month. But I think nobody at Apple is really going to pay much attention to my little rants on this little blog, certainly not now people are grieving over Steve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I decided to think different:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="weekcal-month-design-v2.png">&lt;img src="old-month-vs-redesign.png" alt="Old Month vs Redesign">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the left you see the redesigned month view by UtiliTap after Apple bullied them. It's really amazing how quick they were in redesigning this part of the app and releasing it to the app store. But it's clearly a rush job. It doesn't look as polished as the first version, and I think it needs a redesign.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the right you can see my feeble attempt at a redesign. Apart from the obvious cosmetic changes, there is one feature I added: The dots in the top row of a day are before noon, and the dots in the bottom row are after noon. So now you can not only see how many appointments you have and in which calendar they are, but you can also quickly glance over your month to see if you have a free afternoon or morning. Clever, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sent the design to UtiliTap before writing this blog post, and I really hope they use (some parts) of it. I've told them they can use any part of this design free of charge. Because they provided us with an excellent app for an excellent price, and they didn't deserve to be treated by Apple like this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm looking forward to the next release of Week Calendar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Steve Jobs</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2011/10/08/steve-jobs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2011 21:01:13 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2011/10/08/steve-jobs/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I am truly sorry for the huge loss and wish every Apple employee, family, and friends of Steve strength in these tough times. Through Apple, Steve improved the lives of many people in the world, including mine. By hiring great people and (re)building the Apple brand, he will continue to do so even long after his death. Steve lives on in all of us.&lt;/p>

But the beat marker menu option was grayed out, and I spent some time searching for the &amp;quot;Clip Trimmer&amp;quot; everybody was talking about. I was in a bit of a hurry and all the right-clicks, top menu, gear-icon popup menus, and shortcuts made me overlook the thing I was looking for. Maybe you overlooked it too.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.perpetualkid.com/beach-vacation-countdown-timer.aspx">&lt;img src="timr-1003.jpeg" alt="Count down to your vacation">
&lt;/a>You know how it is on vacation. You take your camera, shoot pictures, and when you get home you see that you forgot to set the date/time on your camera. Even worse: your wife also took a camera with her, and she actually read the manual and set the time correctly. So now you have two sets of photos with mismatching date/times. Now what?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that there is actually a pretty simple trick to solve this, and you don't even haven to install &lt;a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/index.html">exiftool&lt;/a> or do funny command line voodo. If you have iPhoto and a mouse, here's what you do:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [![The Apple Clock](schermafbeelding-2011-08-14-om-23-13-28.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](schermafbeelding-2011-08-14-om-23-13-28.png)Open &amp;quot;Date &amp;amp; Time Preferences&amp;quot; on your Mac and click on the &amp;quot;Date &amp;amp; Time&amp;quot; tab. You should see a clock like the one on the right. With each camera you took on your trip, take a picture of this clock. You don't have to press the shutters all at once, just do this one camera at a time. It also doesn't have to be your Mac's clock, as long as you shoot the same clock with all the cameras.
2. Import the images of all the cameras in iPhoto.
3. Make smart albums (File, New, Smart album…)per Camera type. So if you have a Canon and an Olympus, make one smart album called &amp;quot;Canon&amp;quot; with only the Canon's photos in it, and one &amp;quot;Olympus&amp;quot; smart album with only the Olympus photo's in it:[&lt;img src="screen-shot-2011-08-15-at-00-01-57.png?w=300" alt="iPhoto Smart Album for Canon">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>](screen-shot-2011-08-15-at-00-01-57.png)
4. For each smart album, reverse the sort order so that the photo of the clock you just took is the first in the album. (View, Sort order, Descending).
5. Select all the photo's in the &amp;quot;Canon&amp;quot; smart album, open the &amp;quot;Photos&amp;quot; menu, and select &amp;quot;Adjust date and time&amp;quot;. You'll see the clock you shot with this camera in the thumbnail. Copy the time of the clock in the &amp;quot;Adjusted:&amp;quot;field. All other photo's for that camera will be adjusted, because you selected all photo's in the album:[&lt;img src="screen-shot-2011-08-14-at-23-47-15.png" alt="iPhoto set date and time">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>](screen-shot-2011-08-14-at-23-47-15.png)
6. Repeat step 5 for the &amp;quot;Olympus&amp;quot; smart album.
7. Click on the iPhoto &amp;quot;Photos&amp;quot; library where all your photos are. Your photos should now sync up perfectly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some caveats with this procedure you should remember:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * This only works if nobody changed the date/time settings in the camera between the time they took the photo's and the time you are importing them in iPhoto.
* When cameras are in different time zones, the times will still be off. You'll have to compensate this yourself by adding/subtracting the timezone difference between the camera and the clock of your Mac.
* Remember to select all photos of a specific camera before adjusting the time, or the trick won't work.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://pcweenies.com/tag/mac-app-store-comics/">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-28-53.png" alt="App Store Icon">
&lt;/a>I was happily playing around with the appstore, and came across this funny free game called &amp;quot;Hedgewars&amp;quot;. Originally a free Linux game, it apparently got ported to the Mac and put in the App Store, just as a slew of Flash-based games (yes, Steve has some 'splainin' to do).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to install Hedgewars on my trusty Mac Mini and got this message saying &amp;quot;This Application can not be installed on this machine&amp;quot;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2011-01-08-om-16-45-40.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2011-01-08-om-16-45-40.png?w=300" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->There was no additional information on what was causing this. So the first thing I did was check out my computer information and the requirements for running this game, which seemed to check out fine:
&lt;table width="100%" class="aligncenter" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >[![](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-00-40-38.png?w=122)
](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-00-40-38.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >[![](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-15-55.png)
](schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-15-55.png)
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
I was running the correct version of OSX, so what was the problem here? My neighbor came over and I showed him this funny problem. He found out that Hedgewars could be downloaded from the developers site, and so we did. After opening the DMG, we were greeted with the funny Application Icon decoration show on the right:
&lt;p>&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-18-25.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2011-01-09-om-12-18-25.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Usually this means that the application is compiled for a different system than you're trying to run it on. This can happen when you have an older generation PowerPC processor and try to run a non-universal-binary Intel application. So we checked the properties on the application, and it looked like OSX had it wrong. It's an Intel app, and we're running an Intel Mac. So what gives?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step was to open the Terminal so we could dissect this app on the command line, showing it's inner guts. Apps have all kinds of interesting XML and plist files telling the operating system what to do and how to start it up. Here's what we found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;1,2,8&amp;quot;]
rolf@Mac-mini$ cd Hedgewars.app/Contents/MacOS/
rolf@Mac-mini$ ls -l
total 21344
-rwxr-xr-x 1 rolf admin 2627208 27 dec 21:39 hedgewars
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 rolf admin 5913164 27 dec 21:37 hedgewars-server
-rwxr-xr-x@ 1 rolf admin 2381240 27 dec 21:37 hwengine&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rolf@Mac-mini$ file *
hedgewars: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
hedgewars-server: Mach-O executable i386
hwengine: Mach-O universal binary with 1 architecture
hwengine (for architecture x86_64): Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Hedgewars package has 3 executables, one 64-bit x86, one i386, and one universal binary which only contains an executable for 64-bit x86. We guess the developers made a bit of a mess of this. As expected, we could start the i386 executable just fine:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;]
rolf@Mac-mini$ ./hedgewars-server
Listening on port 46631
^C
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the x86_64 executable and the universal binary would not start:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;quot;text&amp;quot; light=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot; highlight=&amp;quot;1,4&amp;quot;]
rolf@Mac-mini$ ./hedgewars
-bash: ./hedgewars: Bad CPU type in executable&lt;/p>
&lt;p>rolf@Mac-mini$ ./hwengine
-bash: ./hwengine: Bad CPU type in executable
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because this Mac Mini runs a Core Duo, we figured the x86 was okay, but we weren't sure about the 64-bit architecture. A quick peek at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Core">Wikipedia&lt;/a> confirmed our suspicion: The Intel Core Duo is not a 64 bit processor. In fact, 64-bit is the major difference between &amp;quot;Core Duo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Core 2 Duo&amp;quot;. Additional &amp;quot;Googling&amp;quot; showes that &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3696">Apple Support knows that&lt;/a>, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So there you have it. The Mac App Store does not tell you what the problem really is, but chances are that if you get the &amp;quot;Could not install this Application on this machine&amp;quot; error, you have 32-bit architecture (the Core Duo) and the developer compiled the application for 64-bit architecture (the Core 2 Duo).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why in god's name hedgewars has to be a 64-bit application beats me, but that's something I'm not going to change I'm afraid. It turns out that this as been &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/hedgewars/issues/detail?id=147&amp;amp;q=core%20duo">reported as a bug&lt;/a> to the Hedgewars team, which hasn't been picked up yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The good news for older model Intel Mac Mini Core Duo owners out there: You can replace your CPU with a Core 2 Duo processor. You'll need one of these:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Core 2 Duo T7200 (2.00Ghz)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core 2 Duo T7400 (2.16Ghz)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Core 2 Duo T7600 (2.33Ghz).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The processors are quite pricey, our quick check showed that they're all above the $200 price mark, which may be a bit steep for a processor upgrade. We expected about half that, so that was a bummer. Should you want to upgrade your CPU, buy thermal paste, and follow a good howto. To get a feeling of what you're getting into, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Mac-mini-Model-A1283-Teardown/659/1">iFixit teardown of the Mac Mini&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The other option would be to trade in your Core Duo Mac Mini for a Core 2 Duo Mac mini. It's safer and probably about as costly as buying one of the strangely priced Core 2 Duo processors.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Move Time Machine data to a Drobo</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2010/12/30/move-time-machine-data-to-a-drobo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2010 21:05:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2010/12/30/move-time-machine-data-to-a-drobo/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xe7bIfj7VM">&lt;img src="time-machine-drobo.png" alt="Remember, even Drobo's can die. Make sure your files are in at least three different physical locations, one of which preferably off-site.">
&lt;/a>If Santa treated you particularly well this season, or you have put some of your savings to good use, chances are that you have a brand-new Drobo looking at you right now. Meanwhile, your Mac is happily making Time Machine backups to that trusty old local USB disk. So you want to use that new Drobo for Time Machine backups, but don't want to loose history? Here's how (baby steps, no tools required, screenshots included):&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Connect the Drobo (in my case a Drobo FS) to the network and configure an Administrator password for it. You should now have a working Drobo, with at least 2 drives in it, and it shares a &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot; share on the network.
2. Make sure that the free space reported by the Drobo Dashboard is at least as big as your old USB Time Machine drive. Add drives to the Drobo as needed.
3. In the Drobo Dashboard, click on &amp;quot;Advanced Controls&amp;quot;, go to the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; tab, click on &amp;quot;Settings...&amp;quot; and then select the &amp;quot;Shares&amp;quot; tab.
4. Create a new user for your Time Machine backup. It's important to create a non-admin user to keep your data safe. Trust me, you'll thank me later.
5. Create a new Drobo share (the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; on the bottom left), give it a meaningful name and select &amp;quot;Enable Time Machine on this drive&amp;quot;. Be careful in choosing the size, you can't change this later!
6. Remove &amp;quot;Everyone&amp;quot; from the allowed users for this share (the &amp;quot;-&amp;quot; bottom right) and add the user you just created (the &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; on the bottom right). You should now have something like this:[![Create Time Machine share on the Drobo FS screenshot](schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-03-55.png?w=300)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-03-55.png)
7. Close Drobo Dashboard, we won't be needing it anymore.
8. Open System Preferences on your Mac, and select &amp;quot;Time Machine&amp;quot;
9. Click on the &amp;quot;Select Disk&amp;quot; option. Don't worry, we're not damaging or loosing your existing backup by doing this.
10. In the popup, you'll see your newly created Time Machine share on the Drobo. Select this share and fill in the Userid and Password you just created on the Drobo.&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-05-39.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-05-39.png" alt="Select Drobo Time Machine share">
&lt;/a>
11. Wait for Time Machine to start, or force it by using the &amp;quot;Backup now&amp;quot; menu option. Time Machine will first try to create a sparse bundle and calculate what to back up. As soon as you see the backup starting (the &amp;quot;zebra&amp;quot; stripes turn into a normal progress bar), click on the cancel button. We only used Time Machine to create a sparse bundle with the correct settings.
12. In System Preferences, switch Time Machine off.
13. Go to the Drobo Time Machine share you just created and mount the sparse bundle you see there.
14. Open Disk Utility and select the USB Time Machine disk.
15. Click on &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot; and drag the partition of the old USB Time Machine drive to the &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; box. Drag the partition on the mounted Drobo Time Machine disk to the &amp;quot;Destination&amp;quot; box. Double check my screen shot, it's important to get this right. Drag the partitions, not the disks itself. If you're not able to drag the disks as described, you may want to unmount your old Time Machine drive, remount it, and restart Disk Utility.&lt;a href="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-17-22.png">&lt;img src="schermafbeelding-2010-12-28-om-20-17-22.png" alt="Drag partitions in Disk Utility">
&lt;/a>
16. Make sure &amp;quot;Erase Target&amp;quot; is selected and press &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot;. Disk Utility may ask for your password.
17. Prepare for a long wait. If you have more than a 500GB backup drive, you wish you had invested in Gigabit Ethernet right now (yes that speeds it up tremendously). My restore of 800GB over a 100Mb network took more than 2 days.
18. Once the process is finished, do not forget to switch Time Machine back on in the System Preferences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That's it. Time Machine will automatically mount the Drobo Share if needed. The first backup will take a bit more time, I think Apple built in a file check to see if the backup is still ok after moving it to another disk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Tip 1:&lt;/strong> Keep your old USB Time Machine disk next to the Drobo, even if you have an empty slot. By doing this, you can instantly replace a faulty drive without running to the store. Always keep a spare!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>Tip 2:&lt;/strong> Storing data on your Drobo, and then backing up to a Time Machine bundle on that same Drobo is not a backup. A file is only safe if it is stored in 3 different physical locations, one of which is preferably off-site.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy Drobo days!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Car Buying Story</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2010/01/10/the-car-buying-story/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2010 22:50:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2010/01/10/the-car-buying-story/</guid><description>

Stephen needs a new car. Being dilligent and a car lover, he takes the time to write down all criteria for a great car. When he finishes the list, he notices that the only car matching all his criteria is a Ferrari. Well, he always loved a Ferrari so that makes sense. To make things more realistic he adds another criteria, called &amp;quot;price&amp;quot;, and starts looking for alternatives.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->The first car he looks at is practical, but hasn't got the speed of a Ferrari. The second car can carry a lot of stuff, but hasn't got the sound of a Ferrari. The third car is really modular, but hasn't got the looks of a Ferrari. The fourth car is very fast, but doesn't handle as a Ferrari. The fifth car is an independant brand, and can be repaired in any shop, but it breaks down much more often than a Ferrari. The sixth car has a cool design-flip-type-clock and integrated MP3 player, but the manual coming with it does not explain how to operate them.
&lt;p>The seventh car looked too good to be true good in the advertisement. The images in the brochure look stunning. It has everything on his list, and also matches the price criteria. Stephen orders it immediately. But when delivered it does not live up to the whole Ferrari design, look and feel. By far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stephen is not really unhappy and has learned to live with the car's shortcomings. When asked about his new car, Stephen kindly shows it, but the first sentence he regretfuly utters is &lt;em>&amp;quot;but ofcourse, it's not a Ferrari&amp;quot;...&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The moral of this story is: If you don't buy a Ferrari, you'll never own a Ferrari.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-6.jpg">&lt;img src="afbeelding-6.jpg?w=150" alt="Steve Jobs">
&lt;/a>I was happy to see Steve return on the Apple keynote of 9 September, because boy does Apple need somebody with clear vision. The introductions on the new iPod line are all over the place. Let me tell you why I think Steve has not been running the operation for the past few months:&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * **Ringtones.** The price of a ringtone in the iTunes store is (still) higher than that of a song. You can make a ring tone out of a song [for free](http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks) already, so why put the effort into selling ringtones at a way too high price? The phone companies must have influenced some &amp;quot;less sturdy&amp;quot; people at Apple for this.
* **The Nano Camera.** 2 mistakes on this one. First is the device. Why put a camera on the Nano of all iPods? Wouldn't we expect that on the iPod touch? Or perhaps both? Second is the location. Anybody holding a nano must notice that the camera is in a place where your hand is when holding the nano. Maybe it makes a bit more sense in landscape mode, right after you smudged it with your hand. Maybe I'd have to hold one for good testing. I heard that the camera is not nearly as good as the one on the iPhone 3Gs.
* **iTunes 9's Column Browser.** When I installed iTunes 9, my trusty 3-pane music browser was gone. I had a list of artists on the left, and next to that all my music as a long list of unsorted tracks. Gee thanks. After some fiddling I got the 3-paned browser back (see my [earlier blogpost](http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/itunes-9-genre-artist-album-panes-restored/)) but the fiddling in the menus got me that &amp;quot;Windows&amp;quot; feeling of tweaking a crappy UI into something I can sort of use.
* **Genius Mixes.** After seeing the keynote, I was eager to try out the &amp;quot;Genius Mixes&amp;quot; feature. In the keynote, these mixes are available under the Genius item on the left. When I looked, there was nothing there. I searched preferences and menus to turn them on, but found nothing. It turns out that you need to upload Genius data to Apple before the Genius Mixes appear. The mixes themselves are working fine, but when a Genius Mix is playing, you can do nothing. No coverflow. No Track details. I can not even rate the currently playing song. This cripples it's potential of finding and rating great songs in a large library.
* **Syncing knobs and levers.** Where syncing used to be simple, it is now 9 tabs with a slew of boxes and sliders you can drag suff between. I know a lot of customers asked for it, but that has never stopped Apple coming up with a totally brilliant solution to a problem, instead of just implementing the user's crappy first thought. I will get used to it, and it will probably work fine, but it just adds to a scary feeling I had of an Apple without Steve.
* **Twitter integration.** Come on Apple, you are not serious now, are you? There are hundreds of Twitter and IM integration apps that will do something like this. Apple did not even add that &amp;quot;innovative cool juice&amp;quot; to it. They just messed up iTunes codebase with this quick hack, making it even harder to port iTunes to 64 bit Cocoa.
* &amp;quot;**Richer&amp;quot; LP content.** I hate the iTunes appstore pages where developers are using way more CSS and markup than you would like to. It's like the walls of the grocery store change each time you look at a different product. It's confusing and ugly. Now, with the LP stuff added, Apple now is going one step further, and starts selling this for a price. Just like the ringtones.
* **Incoherent iPod touch line.** The 8GB iPod touch is sold at $199, which is great, but it was not &amp;quot;revved&amp;quot;, meaning that the 16+GB iPod touches have a different chipset. How do you explain the customer that a game is running slower on one touch, and faster on the other? Sure it's done to get to the $199 price point, but Apple didn't work like this in the old days. They used to introduce a new (revved) model at the same pricepoint.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The whole talk feels a bit &amp;quot;all over the place&amp;quot;, and a way of charging customers for something they do not really need. I know, usually keynotes get the &amp;quot;woos&amp;quot; from the cround every 15 seconds and it's hard to do that time and time again. And Steve just returned, having to sell the stuff he may not have wanted to put out there in the first place. So I'll forgive them this time. But this fan boy will be watching Apple and hope it will be a bit more consistent next time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-4.jpg">&lt;img src="afbeelding-4.jpg" alt="Jeff? Or Bill?">
&lt;/a>So Steve, get those guys back on track will you? And you might want to do an extra surprise round in the office, because I smell &amp;quot;feature creep&amp;quot;. And is it me, or does Jeff Robin's profile  look like a younger Bill Gates?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hmmm. I hope he doesn't try that silly &lt;a href="http://www.pencomputing.com/frames/tablet_pc.html">tablet-thing&lt;/a> again...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iTunes 9: "Genre-Artist-Album" panes restored</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/09/11/itunes-9-genre-artist-album-panes-restored/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2009 20:31:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/09/11/itunes-9-genre-artist-album-panes-restored/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>What I loved about iTunes is the three pane &amp;quot;Genre-Artist-Album&amp;quot; on top of my music list. It allowed me to quickly go through my music and find that great Anouk album I was looking for. After installing iTunes 9, it was gone. And I was sad. But I found a way to get it back.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniplan/">&lt;img src="opicon.jpg" alt="Omniplan">
&lt;/a>During one of my Omniplan sessions at work, I discovered that the resource leveling was acting a bit funny, where people were not planned to do any work for days. I played around with a fake planning and soon discovered the problem and several solutions to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Imagine you have a 1-man project, with a couple of tasks. You want to keep track of the planning in Omniplan. So you set up a project as follows (sorry for the spelling error, discoverd it after taking all the screenshots):
&lt;p>&lt;a href="planning-constrained.png">&lt;img src="planning-constrained.png" alt="(over)constrained planning">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Everything looks fine and you set out to do your job. While putting the dishes on the sink, you decide to run hot water into the sink and place the dishes directly in the water. That will gain you some time. To reflect that, you slide the progress bar of &amp;quot;wash dishes&amp;quot;. Now your planning looks as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="planning-constrained-progress.png">&lt;img src="planning-constrained-progress.png" alt="(over)constrained planning with progress">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first sight that might not look so strange. But when you look into your resource availability, you see that you are not 100% assigned to the project:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="resources-gap.png">&lt;img src="resources-gap.png" alt="Gap in resources due to completion">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How did this happen? Well, Omniplan says (or rather: you toold Omniplan) that the &amp;quot;wash dishes&amp;quot; task can only start after the &amp;quot;Put dishes on Sink&amp;quot; task was finished. It will hold you to that, wether or not you reported progress on that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution 1&lt;/strong>
The first solution is also a golden rule. Only put constraints in your planning if you are absolutely 100% positive that they need to be there. Removing the constraints from this planning (because you can start washing before everything is in the sync) will result in correct progress and an earlier finish, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="planning-unconstrained.png">&lt;img src="planning-unconstrained.png" alt="unconstrained planning progress">

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Solution 2&lt;/strong>
A collegue of mine has another phylosophy: only have work on your planning that you are going to do in the future. Completed tasks are removed, and existing tasks are shortened as you work on them. Don't use the progress sliders, and measure gain or loss against the baseline planning. This is what I used to do with MSProject until now.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Suppose you have a Java Swing application which you can start by typing the following on the command line:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>java -jar myTerrificSwingApp.jar&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to make that application start from the Finder in OSX, there are a lot of options which range from ugly to convoluted. If you need a quick fix, here's how to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Open ScriptEditor.app on your Mac, and copy paste:
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-- Get path to this script using &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; in stead of &amp;quot;:&amp;quot; as seperators&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>set&lt;/strong> myPath &lt;strong>to&lt;/strong> POSIX path &lt;strong>of&lt;/strong> (path to &lt;strong>me&lt;/strong> as string)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-- Save text item delimiters and set it to &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>set&lt;/strong> delims &lt;strong>to&lt;/strong> AppleScript's text item delimiters&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>set&lt;/strong> AppleScript's text item delimiters &lt;strong>to&lt;/strong> &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-- Get the whole string except the last token, and add a &amp;quot;/&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>set&lt;/strong> myFolder &lt;strong>to&lt;/strong> (text 1 &lt;strong>thru&lt;/strong> text item -2 &lt;strong>of&lt;/strong> myPath) &amp;amp; &amp;quot;/&amp;quot; ¬&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>** as** Unicode text&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-- Restore default text item delimiters (being tidy)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>set&lt;/strong> AppleScript's text item delimiters &lt;strong>to&lt;/strong> delims&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-- Start java from this directory, as nohup and background&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>-- so this applescript can disapear from the Dock&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>do shell script ¬&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;cd &amp;quot; &amp;amp; myFolder &amp;amp; ¬&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;; nohup java -jar myTerrificSwingApp.jar &amp;amp;&amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Save the script as &amp;quot;Application Bundle&amp;quot; and don't forget to un-check the startup window option. If you have some extra time, you can open the package contents of the app, and replace the Contents/Resources/applet.icns with your own icon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot more ways to do this, for instance you can also put your jar file inside the app bundle, or build a double-clickable jar file, or bundle a complete application. You can find more info on all these options on the &lt;a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Java/Conceptual/Java14Development/03-JavaDeployment/JavaDeployment.html">Apple developer website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to put DVD's on your iPhone (for free)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/02/28/how-to-put-dvds-on-your-iphone-for-free/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2009 22:19:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/02/28/how-to-put-dvds-on-your-iphone-for-free/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-13a1.png" alt="For A Few Dollars More">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A lot of companies like to sell you applications to put DVD's on your iPhone. Usually these apps are just wrappers around existing tools, and are pretty expensive if you consider you can do it for free. And you don't need to be a computer wizard either! The steps are simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Use [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/?article=download) to rip the DVD to iPhone format
2. Drag the generated mp4 file into iTunes
3. Sync it to your iPhone like all other content
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>To show you exactly how this is done, I've  written up this &amp;quot;babystep-by-babystep&amp;quot; tutorial. Let me show you how I ripped &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Few-Dollars-More-Clint-Eastwood/dp/0792839056">&amp;quot;For A Few Dollars More&amp;quot;&lt;/a> and put it on my iPhone:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Disclaimer: **The DVD I ripped is bought and payed for. This article does not relief you of your responsibility to obey the law, so please be careful. And be nice, don't pirate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>&lt;!-- more -->What You Need&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [Handbrake](http://handbrake.fr/?article=download) for ripping the DVD
* [VLC](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/), which is used by handbrake for DVD's with encodings not supported by Handbrake. You don't always need it, but download and install it anyway, just to be sure.
* Some patience.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 1: Rip the DVD to an MP4&lt;/strong>
Put a DVD in your Mac, and stop the DVD player application if it opens automatically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-6.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-6.png?w=128" alt="Select VIDEO_TS folder">
&lt;/a>Start Handbrake. A selection window will open, use it to browse to the DVD, and select the VIDEO_TS folder (just select it, no need to go into it) and then press &amp;quot;Open&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-7.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-7.png" alt="Select Title and Chapters">
&lt;/a>Handbrake will briefly scan the DVD for titles. In the &amp;quot;Source:&amp;quot; section of the screen, select a title and the chapters you want to rip. Usually Handbrake guesses that it's the longest title, with the most chapters you want to rip. Let's go with those defaults.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-81.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-81.png?w=44" alt="Presets Selection Drawer">
&lt;/a>Press the &amp;quot;Toggle Presets&amp;quot; button on the top right, and select &amp;quot;iPhone&amp;quot; from the list that pops out on the right side of the Handbrake window.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-10.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-10.png?w=120" alt="Select Audio and Subtitles">
&lt;/a>Next, click the &amp;quot;Audio and Subtitles&amp;quot; tab and select the audio and subtitles you want to listen and read in the ripped video. You can NOT change audio and subtitles later on your iPhone, so choose wisely. This is usually the step I forget, which requires me to wait for the whole ripping process again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-12.png" alt="afbeelding-12">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Make sure the destination file is where you want it, and press the green &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; icon. Handbrake will start reading the DVD and create an MP4 file. This can take a while, so you might want to get a cocktail. Handbrake will show a progress bar in the icon in the dock.
 
&lt;strong>Step 2: Import into iTunes&lt;/strong>
After the ripping is done, you can add your mp4 file to the iTunes library by simply dragging the video file into iTunes. There you can set the title, year, genre and illustration exactly as you did with your music files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-14.png" alt="iTunes showing ripped DVD">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Step 3: Putting it on your iPhone&lt;/strong>
Plug in you iPhone. Go to the iPhone configuration and click on the &amp;quot;Video&amp;quot; tab. Scroll down, and select the video you just imported:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-15.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-15.png" alt="Sync the movie to the phone">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you press &amp;quot;Apply&amp;quot;, iTunes will immediately start copying the movie over to the iPhone, where you can find it in your iPhone in your iTunes library.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Advanced Tips:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * [![Few Dollars More on iPhone](img_0005.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](img_0005.png)The DVD I just converted (For A Few Dollars More) averaged out to about 3,5MB per minute. That's about 5 hours of video per GB, but your mileage may vary. On average you should be able to take at least one or to movies with you on your iPhone. If your music is in the way, you can &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/ipod-synchronization-techniques/">use these tips&lt;/a> to make iTunes organize your music for you.
* Handbrake has an &amp;quot;Add To Queue&amp;quot; button which lets you convert multiple movies in a row. In order for that to work you need to copy the VIDEO_TS folders of multiple DVD's onto a harddrive. Now you can convert multiple DVD's overnight.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DLNA on OSX, done right</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/01/31/dlna-on-osx-done-right/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2009 21:23:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/01/31/dlna-on-osx-done-right/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3">&lt;img src="200x150_playstation3_logo1.jpg" alt="Sony PS3 Logo">
&lt;/a>My wife bought me a playstation 3 last year, and I've enjoyed many hours of gaming on it, finishing Tomb Raider underworld, and now making decent progress in Ratchet and Clank: Tools of Destruction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.dlna.org/home">&lt;img src="afbeelding-22.png" alt="DLNA logo">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was a bit sceptical about the DLNA capabilities of the PS3, because I read a lot of bad news on this fairly new  &amp;quot;Interoperability Guidelines&amp;quot; concept. It sounded like a lot of trouble to go through to simply watch the photos and home videos on a TV. For weeks, I was not able to find a single site telling me how to install a DLNA server on my Mac, or where to find a decent one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Altgough they're hard to find, there are a few OSX DLNA servers out there. One of them is actually very good. Here's what I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**CyberMediaGate**
&lt;p>I found a DLNA server implemented in Java, and didn't get it to work. It misses a Xerces library and I can not seem to get the right version added to the classpath. I decided this was not very &amp;quot;Mac like&amp;quot; and dumped it. Not being able to install software &amp;quot;out of the box&amp;quot; may be normal on Linux, but is unaccepatble on a Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>TwonkyMedia&lt;/strong>
Then, I came across TwonkyMedia. This was the first DLNA server I actually got to work on my Mac, and had it serving video to my PS3. It is a strange (wonky?) piece of software, had no native GUI and only lives on your machine as a webapplication. The installer copies &amp;quot;TwonkyMediaServer.app&amp;quot; in your application folder, starts it, and then opens a browser which points to the local URL of it's configuration screen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At that moment, it already is serving clients, but when you try to access it with the PS3, you will get a protocol error. This is because TwonkyMedia does not come with a default server name. The PS3 aparently can not handle an empty server name. After filling it in and restarting Twonky, I could access it with the PS3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TwonkyMedia does not look very Mac-like, and I don't like the looks of the webpage it is serving. The installer leaves two webloc files on your desktop which point to the configuration screens. It's a bit strange but it gets the job done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Potentially Twonky can do a bit more than CyberMediaGate. Twonky can do some transcoding and other streaming stuff, but I did not try that because I simply wanted to see my photo's and home video's on my TV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The trial version of Twonkymedia last for 30 days, but on the first day it already started acting up on me, and I had to restart it a few times while watching video. The look and feel, and the crashes didn't feel like it was worth the $40 to me, so I uninstalled it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Uninstalling TwonkyMedia requires you to kill the process from the Terminal, and then drag TwonkyMediaServer.app to your trashcan. Another way is dragging the app to the trashcan and then restarting your Mac (not mac-like but it works).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>MediaLink&lt;/strong>
&lt;a href="http://www.nullriver.com/products/medialink">&lt;img src="printablelogo.png" alt="Nullriver Logo">
&lt;/a>The nullriver homepage looked very elegant, and promising. A simple page explains what it is, what it does, and what it costs. Nullriver also allows you to send requests and reports on their site without registering (in contract with TwonkyMedia, to which you have to &amp;quot;sell your soul&amp;quot;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nullriver Medialink comes as a preference pane application, and has a beautifuly simple interface, with not many options. It integrates with your mac applications like iTunes, iPhoto and now even Aperture. It does not have all the fancy configuration options of TwonkyMedia. One of my small complaints is that your content is shared to all DLNA clients on your local network, which may not be what you want if you have more than one DLNA client.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me MediaLink is a perfect fit. I control my own network, my PS3 is my only DLNA client so I don't need the fancy stuff. Most people will be perfectly happy with Medialink. It's simple, transparent, drag-and-drop, has a &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot; button and is cheap. It does not have all the fancy features, but all the features that are in there work flawlessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I played with it for more than a week now, and so far it hasn't crashed on me. I did need to buy a registration key, because the trial version only lasts you for about 30 minutes of watching content (which should be plenty to try it out, and it's not like the 20 bucks are going to kill you).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Conclusion&lt;/strong>
Once again, all DLNA servers I tried put together:&lt;/p>
&lt;table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" border="1" >
&lt;tbody >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >[CyberMediaGate](http://www.cybergarage.org/net/cmgate/java/index.html)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Free
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Terrible, unable to install.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >[TwonkyMedia](http://www.twonkyvision.de/)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >$40
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Works, lots of features, no GUI, buggy/ Crashed on me more than once.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >[MediaLink](http://www.nullriver.com/products/medialink)
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >$20
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Simple, stable, nice GUI, best value for money. Just works.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>&lt;/table>
So if you have a PS3 and a Mac, it's a no-brainer. Buy Medialink!</description></item><item><title>Get well soon</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/01/30/get-well-soon/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2009 23:16:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/01/30/get-well-soon/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.png" alt="Remote Desktop Connection icon">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;quot;Remote Desktop Connection.app&amp;quot; allows you to see the desktop of a remote Windows machine on your mac. This application will not update itself automatically, unless you have it installed as part of the Microsoft Office for Mac suite. If you've downloaded the 1.0.3 version you probably did not notice that &amp;quot;Remote Desktop Connection.app&amp;quot; was updated somewhere last year by microsoft.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find the latest version of Remote Desktop Connection on the &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/remote-desktop/default.mspx">Microsoft Mactopia&lt;/a> site. Version 2 is an improvement over 1.0.3 (which I had). Notable differences are:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Nicer configuration screens, makes configuring your resolution and shares easier.
* Now a Universal Binary, which should improve performance on Intel Macs. I have not noticed improvement, but that's probably because the network is the bottleneck.
* Supports the new RDC 6.0 protocol used by Vista.
* Can do authentication of the remote machine (if it's a Vista machine).
* Your Mac printer can be exposed to the Windows machine so you can print documents on your local printer.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I played with it for a while, and apart form the new looks I can not say it's very different from the 1.0.x version. It could load my old RDC 1.0.3 configuration files. If you need to connect to a Windows desktop from your Mac, this does the job just fine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automount network shares</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/01/18/automount-network-shares/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2009 01:00:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2009/01/18/automount-network-shares/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;img src="afbeelding-2-copy.png" alt="SQuireL SQL on OSX with Oracle drivers">
If you're a SQuirreL SQL fan like me, and you use a Mac, you probably also want to know how to add a driver to the OSX version of the application. Most people just point to an external jar file, but you can also add drivers to the application bundle.  There's not much to it, but it took me some time to discover that I actually had to edit the plist file in the bundle after adding the driver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see on the left, my SQuireLSQL.app now comes with the Oracle OCI and Thin driver built in, and because they are part of the application bundle, I can't wreck my installation by misplacing jarfiles or reconfiguring classpaths. Nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you want to drivers to your SQuireLSQL.app yourself, here's what you need to do:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Download  and unpack SQuirreL SQL for OSX.
2. Verify that is starts up, and that your drivers are missing. Close SQuirreL again.
3. Right-click on SQuireLSQL.app and select &amp;quot;show package contents&amp;quot;.
4. Browse to the **Contents/Resources/Java/lib** folder. Copy the jar file of your driver into this folder (I used ojdbc14.jar in this example)
5. Double-click the **Contents/Info.plist** file. The default plist editor will show up.
6. In the plist editor, find the **&amp;quot;Information Property List&amp;quot;/ Java/ClassPath** property.
7. At the end of the value in this property, add a colon, and a reference to your copied library. In our example (see step 4) I had to add **&amp;quot;:$JAVAROOT/lib/ojdbc14.jar&amp;quot;**, excluding quotes, but including the colon (see other libraries in the path and use them as examples.
8. Save the plist file, and double-click SQuireLSQL.app. Your driver should now have a blue checkmark next to it.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that now you've added proprietary drivers to the bundle, you can no longer freely distribute it. Usage and distribution of your version of SQuireLSQL.app is now &amp;quot;contaminated&amp;quot; by the licences of the driver(s) you installed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy SQL-ing!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eclipse 3.4.1, OSX and Java 1.6</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/12/28/eclipse-341-osx-and-java-16/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2008 14:05:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/12/28/eclipse-341-osx-and-java-16/</guid><description>

&lt;pre>&lt;code>cd /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions
sudo ln -fhsv 1.5 CurrentJDK
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This makes the CurrentJDK link to point to the 1.5 installation of the Java JDK.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bonus tip for today: While you're at it, increase the memory used by eclipse by opening the eclipse.app bundle (right click -&amp;gt; show package contents) and edit Contents/MacOS/eclipse.ini. Change the &amp;quot;-Xmx256m&amp;quot; line to read &amp;quot;-Xmx512m&amp;quot;, and eclipse should be much happier with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse there's &lt;a href="http://help.eclipse.org/stable/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/tasks/running_eclipse.htm">lots more you can do there&lt;/a>, but I always say &amp;quot;keep it simple&amp;quot;.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hex color picker for OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/12/24/hex-color-picker-for-osx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2008 20:20:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/12/24/hex-color-picker-for-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-11.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-11.png?w=182" alt="Hex Color Picker Screenshot">
&lt;/a>If you're working on some source code and you quickly need to insert a hexadecimal color code for a color you currently have on your screen, then here is a neat little trick I found:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, install &lt;a href="http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/">Hex Color Picker&lt;/a> by Waffle software. It will add an extra option to the built-in OSX color picker to show you the selected color in Hex.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reach the color picker, you usually start up any application which uses the standard OSX color picker and just choose &amp;quot;choose color&amp;quot;. What you can also do, is have the OSX color picker behave as a &lt;a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20060408050920158&amp;amp;lsrc=osxh">standalone application&lt;/a> in 3 simple steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open &amp;quot;ScriptEditor&amp;quot;, the Applescript editor.
2. In the main window, type &amp;quot;choose color&amp;quot;
3. Save the script as an application.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The saved application will, you guessed it, show you the standard color picker. Add it to the dock and you will be a happy developer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Please note&lt;/strong>**:** If you are really being a perfectionist, it is possible this will not work for you because the color profiles of you monitor and possibly the profiles which are applied by Safari will introduce errors, because the color picker shows you the color which is on the screen, not the original color coming from the application. There's a whole slew of documentation on color profiles and I do have a whole rant which I will save you from reading (for now).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Merry Christmas!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wiimote Whiteboard</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/12/12/wiimote-whiteboard/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Dec 2008 21:28:39 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/12/12/wiimote-whiteboard/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.uweschmidt.org/wiimote-whiteboard">&lt;img src="wiimotewhiteboard_128.png" alt="WiimoteWhiteboard">
&lt;/a>For people wanting to have an interactive whiteboard but don't have the money, &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/">Johnny Chung Lee&lt;/a> has found the solution. Using a Wiimote, he can track an infrared lightsource (like an LED) and use that to control the mousecursor. I tried some software on the Mac and the PC, and I actually got both to work without too much trouble.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The infra-red pen&lt;/strong>
Please note that you need some kind of Infra-Red emitting device. In my first tests to see if the software works, I used a TV remote. This is a bit clunky, so next on my list is to build a simple infra-red pen this weekend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I noticed a lot of people building infra-red pens by directly connecting an LED to a battery, which will possibly ruin your LED very quickly because there's too much current running through it. An LED is a diode, and it needs to be limited in current. The only right way to do it is follow &lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/pen.jpg">Johnny's schematic&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Whiteboard app on the Mac:
I was amazed about how well this worked. I was expecting a lot of experimental stuff, but instead, this is all you have to do:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [![](afbeelding-21.png?w=47)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](afbeelding-21.png)Download &lt;a href="http://www.uweschmidt.org/files/WiimoteWhiteboard.dmg">WiimoteWhiteboard for the Mac&lt;/a> by Uwe Schmidt.
2. Enable bluetooth on your mac.
3. Start the WiimoteWhiteboard.app
4. On the Wiimote, press buttons 1 and 2 simultaniously to put it in &amp;quot;detectable&amp;quot; mode. If the Wiimote was already on, you may need to press the red button in the battery compartment.
5. After pairing is complete, press the &amp;quot;calibrate&amp;quot; button and follow the instructions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did these steps on an intel  Mac mini and it worked beautifully. You can pair up to 2 Wiimotes to increase reliability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Whiteboard app on the PC:
This is slightly more work, but does not include steps which are strange to regular Windows users:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Download and install the [.Net framework version 3.5](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=333325FD-AE52-4E35-B531-508D977D32A6&amp;amp;displaylang=en)
2. Download Boon Jin's [Smoothboard](http://www.boonjin.com/wp/2008/08/14/wiimote-smoothboard-045-beta) for Windows.
3. [![XP Bluetooth Wizard Screen 1](clipboard02.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](clipboard02.png)Install the .Net framework, and unpack the smoothboard zipfile in a convenient location. It has no setup.exe (thank god)
4. In the system tray on your Windows, right-click the bluetooth icon, and choose &amp;quot;Add a Bluetooth Device&amp;quot;
5. Click the &amp;quot;My device is set up and ready to be connected&amp;quot; checkbox.
6. &lt;a href="clipboard03.png">&lt;img src="clipboard03.png?w=124" alt="XP Bluetooth Wizard Screen 2">
&lt;/a>Press the red button of the Wiimote (in the battery compartement) to unpair it from anything else and get into &amp;quot;detecable&amp;quot; mode.
7. Click the &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; button in the Wizzard
8. Select the &amp;quot;Nintendo RVL-CNT-01&amp;quot; device and click &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot;
9. &lt;a href="clipboard04.png">&lt;img src="clipboard04.png?w=124" alt="XP Bluetooth Wizard Screen 3">
&lt;/a>Select the &amp;quot;Don't use a passkey&amp;quot; radio button and DON'T press &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot;.
10. Press the little red button on the Wiimote again, so that all blue lights start flashing, and then press &amp;quot;Next&amp;quot; on the wizard.
11. In the tray, you should now see popups saying &amp;quot;Found new hardware&amp;quot; and something like &amp;quot;New HID device&amp;quot;. They will dissapear after a while. If the popups did not show, start the whole process again from step 4.
12. Press &amp;quot;Finish&amp;quot; in the Wizard, notice that the Wiimote keeps flashing all the lights.
13. Start Smoothboard. The Wiimote should stop flashing, and you can click on the &amp;quot;Calibrate&amp;quot; button to start the fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="clipboard05.png">&lt;img src="clipboard05.png?w=33" alt="Smoothboard Screenshot">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've tested the Windows setup on a Dell 530 laptop with the built-in bluetooth device, and it works fine, although I did have to reboot once because the bluetooth stack got confused and refused to detect my Wiimote. Smoothboard also allows you to pair 2 Wiimotes to improve reliability. It also has many features which are tailored to controling Powerpoint and other software, but I haven't tried that yet.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Replace your mousecable</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/11/04/replace-your-mousecable/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Nov 2008 23:00:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/11/04/replace-your-mousecable/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="img_0513.jpg" alt="">
I recently tried to purchase a Logitech LS1 mouse from Logitech. After not hearing from them for 3 weeks, I ordered the same mouse at Dynabyte and got it within 5 days. Suddenly Logitech woke up and sent me another LS1 mouse. Because they don't react to mails or calls, I had a spare LS1 to play around with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to replace the long, rigid cable with a short supple one. Here's how you can do that, too.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![](img_0511.jpg?w=59)
&lt;p>](img_0511.jpg)Logitech makes mice, and sometimes nice ones. The trouble is that most mice are for PC users, who have their PC sitting on the floor, far away from the desk. So mouse cables are long, too. Logitech likes to use very ridgid cables for their mice, which sometimes means that the cable will actually have so much &amp;quot;spring&amp;quot; that it will push your mouse back.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Normally I'm behind a laptop, so my mousecable can easily be as short as 30cm, and has to be as supple as the wires on your original iPod headphones. Luck has it, that you can actually change the cable on the Logitech LS1 mouse quite easily, with some patience and a soldering iron.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. [![](img_0517.jpg?w=110)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](img_0517.jpg)Remove the slidepad-stickers to reveal 3 little black screws at the bottom.
2. Open up the mouse.
3. Unplug the white plug and remove the mousecable. The colors on my model were wired &lt;a href="http://pinouts.ru/Slots/USB_pinout.shtml">according to the USB standard&lt;/a>. The leftmost black connects to the housing, the second black is GND, red is VCC, white is D- and green is D+.  
4. Re-use the old plug to solder your own cable onto. I used a very thin mousecable of a very cheap mouse I had lying around, but you can use any supple USB cable you like as long as you get the connections right.
5. &lt;a href="img_0519.jpg">&lt;img src="img_0519.jpg?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a>Plug the new cable back in, and use a little tie-wrap to keep the cable in place in case you pull it.
6. Put it all back together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the observant reader: No, I did not connect the outer housing to ground, you studied the pictures very well. The new cable only had 4 leads. But given the shorter cable, it works fine without interference. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_05241.jpg">&lt;img src="img_05241.jpg?w=300" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And finally the mouse with the old and the new cable. See the difference? The old cable almost looks like a sewer pipe compared to the new thinner cable. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you'll excuse me, I'm going to replace the other LS1 mouse with a white USB cable to match my mac :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and don't order your Logitech mouse directly from Logitech, their webshop is crappy, and their customer support is impossible to reach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The iPhone buying experience</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/10/11/the-iphone-buying-experience/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2008 18:28:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/10/11/the-iphone-buying-experience/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Ok so I've been &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/01/10/apple-reinvents-phone-ipod-and-userinterface-in-1-go/">blogging about&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/01/13/see-the-iphone-demo/">the iPhone&lt;/a> and&lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/cowbell/"> it's &amp;quot;apps&amp;quot;&lt;/a> for a while now. After a lot of consideration and switching between Nokia and iPod touch, doing nothing and buying a 16GB 3G iPhone, I finally went for the latter. What a bittersweet experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->We have no real Apple stores. They're called "Apple authorized resellers" and may look like an Apple store, but they're not. Because they are run by slow Dutch people (I get to that in a minute), and don't have geniuous bars, and can't seem to be of help unless you want to buy something.
&lt;p>In the Netherlands, you can by an iPhone at T-mobile shops, or at the Apple store. At the T-Mobile stores, there are often no iPhones in stock. At the Apple stores (let's call 'em that, to humor them) the employees know nothing of cellphone contracts. Because I like the interiour of the Apple store better, I decided to get my iPhone there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I went for the black 16GB 3G model, because the white one is just a bit to &amp;quot;girly&amp;quot;, and is easy to spot 100 miles away for any bad guys out to steal iPhones. I came prepared with copies of my passport and old SIM card. The guy behind the counter went into the storage room to get one. Then something strange happened: a &lt;a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels&lt;/a> session was started up, and an Internet Explorer browser opened to show a HTTPS page at which we could fill in a contract form. It took ages to start up, and the T-Mobile &amp;quot;special registration form&amp;quot; was teribly slow. The Apple salesman was not very fast either, I had to correct him more than once because he didn't read the instruction on the screen. All in all I spent 37 minutes (measured) in the store to get everything registered and payed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(I am still wondering why the T-Mobile registration page could not have been opened in Firefox or Safari on OSX.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a week, T-mobile sent a letter saying that my old number could not be ported. I called customer support and as it turned out, the guy at the Apple store still didn't fill in the form correctly (I wonder what he missed after staring at 2 html forms for 37 minutes). After being on hold for over 28 minutes at the T-Mobile helpdesk, they solved everything and my original number got transfered within 3 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So here I am, with an iPhone. Prepare to read a lot about it. ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Attention to Detail</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/09/14/attention-to-detail/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2008 08:54:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/09/14/attention-to-detail/</guid><description>
&lt;p>As I explained earlier, I think it is really important to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/07/12/conform-specs-is-not-enough/">go beyond the specs&lt;/a>. It's really important to put care and attention in your product. The new version of iTunes has a great (little) example of what I mean. I use Itunes to play music through both the computer speakers and a stereo in the livingroom, connected to an Airport Express.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In iTunes 7, when I added the Airport Express to the set of outputs while playing a song, the music stopped, and after a while resumed playing through all the selected outputs. I never minded the short silence, and was amazed at how Apple got all the outputs to play perfectly in sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In iTunes 8 things changed a tiny bit. When I select the Airport Express, the music keeps on playing on my computer, and after a few seconds the music also starts playing from the speakers in the living room. An still, the music is in sync.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It's these little things, the amazing attention to detail, that give Apple products a tremendous &amp;quot;perceived value&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That, and the Genius button ofcourse. :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Bigger Time Machine without Changing History</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2008 20:31:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/09/07/a-bigger-timemachine-without-changing-history/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I had a 160GB drive holding my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/backup-guru-give-me-a-break/">Time Machine backups&lt;/a>. Because I wanted to backup external disks, and still wanted to be able to travel about a year back in time, I bought a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/09/07/osx-format-1tb-usb-drive/">1TB USB disk&lt;/a>. Stephen Foskett wrote a &lt;a href="http://blog.fosketts.net/2008/07/26/how-to-move-os-x-time-machine-backups-to-a-new-disk/">great article&lt;/a> about how he migrated his TimeMachine backup to a larger disk, but it's lengthy and misses one essential step.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided to give you the short version, this blog post describes how I migrated Time Machine to the new disk without losing any data in 11 easy steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Get a new, big, empty drive with a single Mac Journaled partition on it. Give it a good name so you can keep it apart from the original Time Machine drive.
2. Open the Time Machine configuration screen, and turn off Time Machine.
3. Unmount and remount the Time Machine drive, it should show up as an ordinary orange drive on your desktop.
4. Open Disk Utility, and click the &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot; Tab.
5. [![](copy-timemachine-drive.png)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>](copy-timemachine-drive.png)Drag the &amp;quot;TimeMachine&amp;quot; partition which is on the old drive to the &amp;quot;Source&amp;quot; box.
6. Drag the large partition on the new drive to the &amp;quot;Target&amp;quot; box.
7. Select &amp;quot;Erase Target&amp;quot;. If you do not check this, the disc copy will fail. This is the essential step I mentioned earlier.
8. Click &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot;, double check the popup warning to see if you are doing the right thing and press &amp;quot;Restore&amp;quot; again. After a number of hours, depending on the speed of your USB hub and the size of the disks, you will see 2 identical drives on your desktop. The new drive should have a lot more space available. In my case, it took 5 hours to migrate 160GB to the new drive.
9. Unmount the old Time Machine drive, physically disconnect it to be sure.
10. Open the Time Machine configuration screen, and turn on Time Machine.
11. In the Time Machine configuration screen, press &amp;quot;Change drive&amp;quot; and select the new drive. You will see the disk icon turn into the green TimeMachine drive icon. You're done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can test Time Machine now by clicking the Time Machine icon in your dock and see that you still have all your history. Once you've verified that all your history is still there, you can use your old Time Machine drive for something else (reformat it).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might also want to check your spotlight settings to not include your Time Machine drive for searching. Because I did not touch the volume name on the new drive, I didn't have to change any settings, but I checked to be sure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Bonus tip:&lt;/strong>
Now that you've got a large backup drive, maybe it's time to think about backing up your external drives. Make sure all the drives you want to backup are connected, and open the Time Machine configuration screen. Click on &amp;quot;Options...&amp;quot; and remove the drives you want to back up from that list.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSX: Formatting a 1TB USB Drive</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/09/07/osx-format-1tb-usb-drive/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Sep 2008 11:50:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/09/07/osx-format-1tb-usb-drive/</guid><description>

&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open Apple's Disk Utility
2. Click on the drive (not the partition in it, if there is any), and select &amp;quot;Partitioning&amp;quot;.
3. Select &amp;quot;1 partition&amp;quot; and then press &amp;quot;Options&amp;quot;.
4. You'll see that &amp;quot;MBR&amp;quot; is the default, which is what's causing the problem. Select the middle option &amp;quot;Apple Partition&amp;quot; and you're good to go.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>In Windows, there is a great tool called &lt;a href="http://www.stevemiller.net/puretext/">&amp;quot;PureText&amp;quot;&lt;/a> which sits in your tray, and can remove formatting from copy/paste actions if you want to. In stead of pasting into notepad, and then copying it again, you now can use the Windows-V combination to paste without formatting. It works in any program, and I'm a fond user of this little gem at work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In OSX, you can do this with a key combination, Option-Shift-Command-V. Besides being the silliest and most awkward key combination ever to do a simple paste-action, it does not always do the job properly. I found this &lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/simx/technonova/C488455530/E20071125225334/index.html">great tip&lt;/a> where a simple applescript removes formatting from the items in your clipboard.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->If you don't know how to save this script, do the following:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Open the Apple Script Editor (use Spotlight if you don't know where to look for it)
2. In the editor window, paste the following text:set the clipboard to «class ktxt» of ((the clipboard as text) as record)
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>beep
3. Click &amp;quot;Compile&amp;quot; and then select &amp;quot;Archive -&amp;gt; Save As...&amp;quot;
4. Save the script as an application (anywhere you think is appropriate)
5. Drag the resulting app into your dock to have it handy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It looks like a lot of work, but these are the absoluut smallest steps I can help you with. It's really simple. When you're done, select any text you want to copy, and press Command-C to copy it. Then, before pasting, start the app you just made. You'll here the system beep indicating that it's ready. Now you can use Command-V and presto, plain text, no formatting!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use this a lot to copy text from mails and documents into my Evernote, and it works fine. The only small irritation is the extra mouseclick.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Macbook Pro Screen update issues</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/08/18/macbook-pro-screen-update-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Aug 2008 18:54:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/08/18/macbook-pro-screen-update-issues/</guid><description>
&lt;p>My wife has this great Macbook Pro 15&amp;quot;, and I &amp;quot;don't mind&amp;quot; using it every now and then. I noticed that when running on batteries, screen updates are a bit strange:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * When scrolling down a webpage, the page get garbled. Scrolling the garbled piece out of the window and in again sometimes fixes it.
* When resizing a Finder window, the icons in the window flicker a lot, you can see them being cleared and redrawn.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I noticed more people having these problems on several forums, and I also read that resetting the PRAM could fix it. Well, I just reset the PRAM and it seems to have fixed it, indeed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For those of you who think that media and information are free and uncontroled, guess again. Lately I have been seeing more and more incidents of large corporations hiding information, and even telling other people to hide it for them. I think this is plain wrong, and the guys involved should have been fired or punished otherwise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have information which is of interest to the public, and somebody is making you sign a paper with which he can force you to shut up, you should think twice (and then not do it). Not because of the money, not because of the information itself, but for the sheer principle. Information should not be controled in that way. By anyone. It is dangerous.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When do these people realize that witholding information is only postponing the inevitable fact that people are going to hear about the stuff they are trying to hide? Are they really thinking that people all over the world, connected in all kinds of different ways, aren't going to notice what you are doing?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse, they are doing a pretty darn good job so far, but it will break down eventually.

&lt;p>In this strange world, people can't seem to leave your stuff alone. All the electronic gadgets of today are too attractive to the lowlife of this world. So what do you do if somebody swipes your laptop? You take a few pictures of him, and trace his IP address!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->This kind of software has been around for a while, and a few companies have made good money of of it. The closed source solutions are also feeding information to those companies when you don't want it to, and you're also not sure what information is send to the company.
&lt;p>There is now a solution for the more paranoid geeks amongst us. It's called &lt;a href="http://adeona.cs.washington.edu/index.html">&amp;quot;Adeona&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, and it is the first Open Source system for tracking the location of your lost or stolen laptop. The software does not rely on a proprietary and/or central service, and is entirely free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What's also nice is that only the owner (that's you) can access the machine should you want to trace it. If you don't trust me, and don't trust Adeona, you can always check the sourcecode yourself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A laptop is the most logical target of the casual thief, so it makes sence to install it on there. A casual thief is usually not tech savvy, so before he discoveres that Adeona (or any other similar program) you will have usually traced him.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Burglars also tend to take your desktop machine, so you might aswel install Adeona on there, too. And since Adeona comes as an OSX, Linux and Windows program, most of the computers out there will be covered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I only wish that I could live in a world where people could appreciate other people's toys without touching or stealing them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Migrate from Windows to OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/06/18/migrate-from-windows-to-osx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Jun 2008 19:09:36 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/06/18/migrate-from-windows-to-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>My wife got tired of her Windows/Compaq laptop. So 2 weeks ago, she decides to go out and buy a &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">15&amp;quot; macbook pro&lt;/a> (an excelent choice I might add). She was a bit worried about getting used to the new machine, but decided to take the risk. After no more than 3 days, with surprisingly little help, she figured out how to do everything she did on the Windows machine, and even installed her own software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The last thing to do was to migrate all the stuff from her old Windows machine to her new &amp;quot;lappie&amp;quot; (yes, she actually gave this one a nickname :-) ). Although Microsoft tries hard to keep Outlook Express users &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in">locked in&lt;/a>, I did find a tool that solved the problem completely for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**Bookmarks**
&lt;p>&lt;a href="menubarcheck.jpg">&lt;img src="menubarcheck.jpg?w=77" alt="Turn on IE7 Menu Bar">
&lt;/a>This is an easy thing to do. Most browsers can export their bookmarks easily, and Safari can import them easily. There was one little thing that took some time figuring out: IE7 hides your menu bar, which prevents you from finding the &amp;quot;File -&amp;gt; Export Bookmarks...&amp;quot; option. You can turn the menubar back on by clicking on the &amp;quot;Tools&amp;quot; menu, and selecting &amp;quot;Menu bar&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that you've got the &amp;quot;File&amp;quot; menu in Internet Explorer, I think you can figure out the rest for yourselves. Import the resulting HTML into Safari by using the &amp;quot;Archive -&amp;gt; Import Bookmarks...&amp;quot; option and you're done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>**Outlook Express export
**&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="outlook-mappen.png">&lt;img src="outlook-mappen.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Outlook Express is a bit trickier. First, you need to find your mailbox files. Normally, finding files is not a big problem, but Microsoft has crippled the &amp;quot;Search&amp;quot; functionality in Explorer to such a degree that you can't actually find your mailbox files with it. So, Choose &amp;quot;Start -&amp;gt; Run...&amp;quot; and type in &amp;quot;cmd&amp;quot;. The black box you'll see is a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmEvPZUdAVI">DOS Prompt&lt;/a>. Open your Outlook express and take a look at the names of your mailbox Folders. On yor filesystem, there are &amp;quot;dbx&amp;quot; files which correspond with these. For the example on the right, we can find all dbx files with the following commands:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#999999;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;C:\Documents and Settings\YourLoginName&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;cd \
&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#999999;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;C:\&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;dir /s /b *.dbx
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You'll get a list of complete filenames (drive, directory and filename) of the Outlook Express dbx files found on your system. Close Outlook Express, find the corresponding files and copy them into a temporary folder for convenience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we've got the dbx files containing all the mail, we need to convert those into a format which can be read by Mail.app. To do that, download &lt;a href="http://freenet-homepage.de/ukrebs/english/dbxconv.html">DbxConv&lt;/a> and unzip it in the same temporary folder you just created.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go back to your DOS Prompt, go into the directory where your dbx files and DbxConv are, and use the following command to convert everything into &lt;a href="http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/mbox.html">mbox files&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#999999;&amp;quot;&amp;gt;C:\temp\&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;DbxConv *.dbx
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Take the resulting mbox files and put them on your new Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mail.app import&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-11.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-11.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>Open &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html">Mail.app&lt;/a> and configure it without worrying about it getting your mail or creating mailboxes. All done? Good. Select &amp;quot;Archive -&amp;gt; Import Mailbox...&amp;quot; from the menu at the top of your screen. Select the &amp;quot;mbox&amp;quot; format, and then select all the mbox files you've just put on your Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mail.app will import all the mailboxes, and place them in a folder called &amp;quot;Imported Mailboxes&amp;quot;. In this folder, you'll find additional Folders, one per mbox file. All your mail will be in those folders, including the correct dates, attachments and even read/unread information. Drag the mails to any Folder you like, for instance the &amp;quot;Inbox&amp;quot; folder contents can be dragged to... you guessed it, your Mail.app &amp;quot;Inbox&amp;quot;. It will merge perfectly, like you've always been using Mail.app.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>MSN and GoogleTalk&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're a GoogleTalk user, you can get away with &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/ichat.html">iChat&lt;/a> , the built-in chat client in Leopard. Just &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24076">set it up&lt;/a> to use the google server and youre good to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you're an MSN user, you can try &lt;a href="http://www.amsn-project.net/download.php">aMSN&lt;/a>, which should look very familiar to you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you use both GoogleTalk and MSN, and possibly other chat clients, your best bet is to go with &lt;a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium&lt;/a>. Adium is the chat client of my choice, but it can not do audio or video, so be warned (to me this is a big plus by the way :-) ).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Make a Disk Image&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition to migrating your mail and bookmarks, you need to move your data to your new machine, too. There's always a chance that you forget to move stuff. So keep your old PC for another month or so, or even better: Make a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/06/06/clone-windows-hd-on-apple-osx-machine/">disk image&lt;/a> from the harddisk. You can now safely trash your PC (&lt;a href="http://dban.sourceforge.net/">wipe that harddisk first&lt;/a>) without having to worry about lost data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Do yourself another favour: Buy a 500GB (or bigger) harddisk, and reserve it for backups only. Hook it up to your new Mac and you'll be automagically introduced to Apple's excelent zero-setup, zero-fuss &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/timemachine.html">TimeMachine&lt;/a>. You'll be very happy, &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/02/21/time-machine-to-the-rescue/">trust me&lt;/a>. Or &lt;a href="http://blog.bernardkowalski.com/?p=3">trust others&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun with your new computer!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WWDC 2008 Keynote video</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/06/10/wwdc-2008-keynote-video/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 20:25:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/06/10/wwdc-2008-keynote-video/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.png" alt="Teribly irritating to see crippled video every 5 minutes like this. Apple come on!">
&lt;/a>I was watching the WWDC2008 text feeds yesterday (like the one from &lt;a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/06/09/steve-jobs-keynote-live-from-wwdc-2008/">Engadget&lt;/a>), and today the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/0806wdt546x/event/index.html">WWDC2008 video&lt;/a> is online. It's always better to watch this than to read an interpreted &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/theilife">twitter feed&lt;/a>. Today it was a bit of a challenge to view it because a lot of people are probably with me. I always set Quicktime to use the HTTP protocol over port 80, because that forces all the network packets to arrive in the correct order, and does not allow dropped packets.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![How to set Quicktime to use the HTTP protocol](afbeelding-1.png?w=128)
&lt;p>](afbeelding-1.png)On the left, you can see how I've configured to be able to see the keynote without too much problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the middle of all the nerdy &amp;quot;look we've ported a game&amp;quot; presentations, there was actually a very cool one. Mark Terry, a software developer for an English insurance company, has created an incredible piece of music software for the iPhone, called &lt;a href="http://moocowmusic.com/Band/">&amp;quot;MooCow Music Band&amp;quot;&lt;/a>. At about 40 minutes into the WWDC2008 Keynote video, you'll find his really nice demo, with cheers from the crowd.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There's also a nice discussion on background processes and how they influence performance and battery life. It shows how, on a Samsung with Windows mobile, the user has to figure out which process to end. This then all leads to a discussion on the new Push Notification architecture in the iPhone 2.0 software which prevents software from having to poll servers. It also keeps your phonebill low, because there are no bits going back and forth to the phone every 10 seconds to see if the world has changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chinese character recognition was also a nice feature, it solves the problem with the Chinese language characters (of which there are a lot).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.me.com">&lt;img src="keynote_page_mobileme20080609.jpg" alt="Mobile Me logo">
&lt;/a>Finally, after a lot of complaints about .Mac not being up to par, Apple introduces &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">Mobile Me&lt;/a>, which replaces .Mac. Mobile Me finally looks like it expect to be looking for a proper Apple solution. It synchronizes with Apple and Windows platform, aswel as your iPod touch and iPhone. It has push notification, so that everything is synched immediately. The web interface is almost identical to Apple's Mail, contacts is looking like Address Book, etc. etc. Everything looks and feels like a desktop application. Lot's of AJAX-like functionality in there, which allows drag and drop, and on the fly contacts filtering, photo-skimming, image resizing and rotating...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What's also nice is the ability to take a picture with the iPhone (however bad the quality ;-) ) and immediately put it online in your really cool online Apple gallery. Really cool stuff and with the 20GB storage space finally worth considering the subscription. Let's hope they don't get into trouble with the other &lt;a href="http://www.mobileme.com.au/mobileme/index.wl">mobileme&lt;/a>'s &lt;a href="http://www.multiedit.com/mobileME.php">out&lt;/a> &lt;a href="http://norman.walsh.name/2007/08/01/mobile">there&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the keynote, the new iPhone is introduced. 3G (UMTS) and built in GPS, better battery life, enterprise integration, and at a lower price. It's been on the news, and you probably have heard about the new iPhone already by now. Good news for me is that it's finally comming to the Netherlands. I only hope that I can buy it unlocked, because I'm not sure I want to switch to T-Mobile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-3.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.png?w=50" alt="The iPhone 3G, finally in White.">
&lt;/a>At 1 hour and 28 minutes into the keynote, there's a funny situation where Steve waits for a large website to load on the (old) EDGE iPhone. The 3G iPhone is about 2 to 3 times as fast as the EDGE phone, and approaches wifi speeds over 3g (UMTS) networks. Steve demonstrates the speed increase of the new iPhone, and the slow competition with the funny layouts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Features which seem to be little but are quite important to people: It has a flush headphone connector so you can use any headphone you'd like, and it's available in white (only if you buy the 16GB model for $299).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wonder when it will be available in Russia... :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Clone Windows HD on Apple OSX machine</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/06/06/clone-windows-hd-on-apple-osx-machine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jun 2008 21:07:34 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/06/06/clone-windows-hd-on-apple-osx-machine/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Last week, lightning struck at my parents apartment building (literaly). Other damages aside, my dad's PC also died.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The guy at the PC repair shop warned my dad that &lt;em>&amp;quot;we may need to wipe the HD, do you have a backup&amp;quot;?&lt;/em> Ofcourse, all data was backed up daily and &amp;quot;off-site&amp;quot; at my house so all important data was safe. But just in case, we wanted to make an exact disk image of the drive, so that we could easily restore it when the PC returns from the store&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I wanted to have a future proof process, run on a Mac, something as follows:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Make an image file of the complete source harddisk including all partitions (in our case there were 3 NTFS partitions on the disk). The image file includes any boot records or loaders if they exist, and is an Apple DMG file so it can be mounted on OSX.
2. Store the image file on a server disk (so it in turn gets backed up)
3. When there's trouble, we now have 2 options, which are
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>a) mount the image and restore 1 or 2 important files
b) write/restore the image to a new disk&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we bought a second 500GB drive to play around with, and try the restores on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Mac Disk Utility, I made an &amp;quot;MBR&amp;quot; disk image of a drive. Mounting this image gave me the access to all 3 NTFS partitions and data on them. However, for some strange reason, Disk Utility could not restore it's own disk image to the drive,  because it does not allow me to drag the target disk into the target disk field (use google to find more people having this problem). Mucking around with the command line tool &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)">&amp;quot;dd&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, I actually managed to restore the DMG back onto a physical drive, but for some reason, the primary partition was damaged.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Digging around on the internet, I found that the following method may be the only reliable way to do this and meet all my requirements. It's relatively simple, although it does take a trip to the command line (which is really not very Apple like).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Backup the DRIVE, not a PARTITION&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What Apple calls a &amp;quot;drive&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disk&amp;quot; is actually often just a partition on a physical disk. A physical disk can have multiple partitions, which appear as multiple &amp;quot;disks&amp;quot; in the Finder or Disk Utility. Because we want to make an image of the physical disk, we need to find out where that disk is. In the Terminal, use to following command:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>diskutil list
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You'll get a list of all the physical drives, and the partitions which are on there. For example, our testdisk shows up as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>/dev/disk3
   #:                   TYPE NAME      SIZE     IDENTIFIER
   0: FDisk_partition_scheme          *465.8 Gi disk3
   1:             DOS_FAT_32 TESTDISK 465.8 Gi disk3s1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The physical disk is known to the system as /dev/disk3, and the first (and only) pastition on there is a FAT32 partition, and the name of the partition is TESTDISK. To make a DMG of the complete disk with all it's partitions, the following command is enough:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>dd if=/dev/disk3 of=/Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>The command will take a (long, long) while to complete. I've read some posts where people were waiting for days for dd to complete their image. There's also no progress bar. Terrible, but for now I can't help you with this without getting into rediculous trickery as found on some &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b1cyNigny8">l33tsp34k&lt;/a> hippie h4xor blogs out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fun thing about this trick is, that OSX is able to mount that DMG file. You just double-click it, and &amp;quot;&lt;a href="http://www.boomcounter.org/">boom&lt;/a>&amp;quot;. There are your partitions. A big problem is that these images are uncompressed. So you'll need 500GB free space to backup a 500GB drive. That's not funny. You can circumvent that by having the data zipped before writing it to disk but that means you'll not be able to mount it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Writing it in compressed form (which is even slower) can be done like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>dd if=/dev/disk3 | gzip -9 &amp;gt; /Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg.gz
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Restore the DRIVE (not the partition)&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To restore a dmg onto a physical disk, get a disk which is at least the size as the original disk. Having the original disk's size in the filename like in the example above helps you to remember that in a few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After checking which disk you need to write to with the diskutil (as shown abve), restoring an uncompressed disk image merely requires you to swap input and output parameters, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>dd if=/Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg of=/dev/disk3
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that this works because in my case I haven't rebooted or reconnected drives, so the drive I need to write to is still /dev/disk3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you did the gzip compression trick mentioned above, you need to get a bit more fancy:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat /Users/rolf/MyCompleteDisk100GB.dmg.gz | gzip -d | dd of=/dev/disk3
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Although all of this works, I hope that somebody, somewhere can show me a simple, clean, OSX native, GIU based solution to this, meeting the 3 requirements in this article.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Difference between Windows and OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/27/difference-between-windows-and-osx/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 May 2008 04:00:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/27/difference-between-windows-and-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Another great example showing the differences between OSX and Windows. Bot applications synchronize your phone over bluetooth. Both applications are simple to use, but one is simpler. And contrary to expectations, this time the Windows version (left) will cost you money, and the OSX version (right) is free.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="sync.gif">&lt;img src="sync.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a> &lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.png?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although you'd expect the Windows version to do more with all these bells and wistles on the screen, but it's actually &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISync">iSync&lt;/a> that also synchronizes the calendar to my phone, and back. Automatically. No configuration needed, it does what is considered logical to the sensible mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple and OSX are just like a &lt;a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Volkswagen_New_Beetle_Germany.jpg">Volkswagen New Beetle&lt;/a>. Either you like it, or you don't. But either way, it's good that it's here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>For the record: I don't like the Volkswagen New Beetle, and I do like OSX. My Mac Mini is absolutely by far the best computer I have bought in the past 5 years, maybe even the best computer I've bought ever. No kidding.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don't buy: Belkin TuneCast II</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/23/dont-buy-belkin-tunecast-ii/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2008 18:42:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/23/dont-buy-belkin-tunecast-ii/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="341843_rb_00_fbeps.jpg">&lt;img src="341843_rb_00_fbeps.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>I am in the market for a new car. That means I'm in the market for a new car stereo. I decided that the iPod is a far better way to listen to my music in stead of keeping CD's in the car or listening to the 10.000 crappy FM stations in the Netherlands. Since &lt;a href="http://www.dension.com/icelinkgateway500.php">Dension&lt;/a> does not make a cable for my new car, I decided to go for an FM transmitter. Buying the cheap Belkin TuneCast II FM transmitter, I got even less then what I payed for.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->It looks promising from the package, but it was really a big waste of money. When operated using the included AAA batteries, I get no reception at all. Only when using the 12V car adapter the power output slightly increased and I was able to get the car radio to pick up the TuneCast signal, but only with very much static noise.
&lt;p>I took it out of the car to make sure the problem was not my car radio. At home, I put the TuneCast on top of the home stereo (only 4 cm away from the antenna). It was still very hard to get a signal at all, and I have never got it working without any static noise.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the manual, the iPod should be set to a moderate volume, and once connected the TuneCast will automatically switch on. In my case, I had to turn the volume of the iPod all the way to 100% before the TuneCast switched on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once I spent 20 minutes of fiddling and finding a free frequency (the Netherlands is crowded with radio signals), I noticed that the output volume of the TuneCast is also very low. In the car, I need to crank up the volume to 100% on my car radio to get a normal listening level. This means that if I switch stations by accident, I can possibly blow up my speakers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My conclusion is: the TuneCast II does not do what it promises. It's output power is way too low, even on 12V car power, it needs high volume input and produces low volume output with a lot of static noise, even when being VERY close to the reciever antenna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>DO NOT BUY THE BELKIN TUNECAST II&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Edit:&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9511.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9511.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>After typing this post I decided to try to get more signal out of the Tunecast. It did not work, but I did find out which terminals to use when trying to get signal from the tunecast. Maybe you can wire it straight into your radio or something. I'm not planning on doing that, but here are some pictures of the mods I tried to do. It might get you started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Opening the TuneCast II is really simple, there is 1 screw underneath the &amp;quot;QC&amp;quot; sticker in the battery compartment. Take it out. Pry the two halves of the tunecast loose they are interlocked with small plastic pins, nothing you can break easily.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9512.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9512.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Once opened, you can remove another screw to take out the printed circuit board. On the front side of the circuit boart you'll notice the wires going to the earphone plug. The antenna of the Tunecast is incorprated in the (rather short) earphone cable. In my case this was the blue wire (also marked with &amp;quot;ANT&amp;quot;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9513.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9513.jpg?w=114" alt="">
&lt;/a>If you flip over the PCB, you can see a few testing points. Two of these can be used to attach a small dipole antenna. TP9 is ground, and TP8 is the antenna output. I tried making a &lt;a href="http://www.electronics-radio.com/articles/radio/antennas/dipole/fm-dipole-antenna.php">small dipole&lt;/a>, but transmision power was not increased enough to get a clear signal to my radio (still 4cm away from the radio). I think the output power can be routed into an FM amplifier so the whole neighbourhood can listen to your station, but for me that's not an option since I was looking for a simple and small device to listen to my iPod in the car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_9518.jpg">&lt;img src="img_9518.jpg" alt="">
&lt;/a>Another interesting tip: I noticed that the &amp;quot;backlight&amp;quot; is really not a backlight, but 2 green leds mounted somewhere near the LCD. If you'd like to get slightly more light onto the LCD, you can try to paint the inside of the casing using white matt paint (like shown).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok that's it, I'm throwing mine in the garbage can and will start looking for something else. I hope you enjoyed this €25,- blog post.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Again and Again</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/20/again-and-again/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2008 21:44:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/20/again-and-again/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A while ago there was a bit of a hype on the net around the song &lt;a href="http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=cOEKASLb4lM">&amp;quot;Again and Again&amp;quot;&lt;/a> by &amp;quot;the Bird and the Bee&amp;quot;.

&lt;p>Google calendar is the new &amp;quot;Cool&amp;quot; in the calendar world. Or at least, the guys at work seem to think so. For me, a 100% online calendar is not always a good solution, because I can't take it with me. Getting Google calendar to sync with iCal would help, because that syncs to my phone and iPod. I tried BusySync and Spanning Sync to do this. One of them succeeded.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I've always been a FiloFax guy. My organizer is a typical one, it's rather big, and contains all business cards, papers, copies and notes I think are important enough to carry around. Every now and then (about every 2 years when I think about it) I try to migrate to a digital version. I've had a [Psion 3c](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psion_3), an [HP iPaq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipaq), I tried to do the "[Print](http://www.43folders.com/forum/2007/10/10/google-calendar-index-card)-a-[Google](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=41067)-[Calendar](http://lifehacker.com/358308/convert-your-google-calendar-to-pdf)" trick, and even briefly used my [Sony Ericsson T610](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Ericsson_T610) as my calendar.
&lt;p>Every time, after a while, I find myself switching back to my trusty FiloFax. Usually because something happens to my calendar, or me not being able to access it. Failing backups, failing batteries, unreadable screens, awkward interfaces, and inability to scribble a simple drawing in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last weekend I entered a new cycle of getting it all digital again. I've been digital for a complete week now, and it doesn't feel too awkward. Maybe this time it will work...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Backing up&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before trying anything, I backed up my Google Calendars and iCal calendars. There wasn't much in them, but it's nice to be able to return to a known state. Yes, I have Time Machine but the trick of a backup system is not having to rely on it in your daily work. So here are 2 important links:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;amp;answer=37111">Backing up your Google Calendar&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://leopardtips.blogspot.com/2007/11/back-up-ical-and-address-book.html">Backing up your iCal Calendar&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Problem&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get a usable solution to view and update my calendar online aswell as on the road, without manual actions to get everything synchronized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The Solution&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Use Google Calendar for online editting, use iCal as central hub for synchronizing to all my devices, use my Nokia 6300 for viewing and editting on the road. My iPod nano is a nice extra for viewing my calendar when my phone dies on the road.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple has done a great job of synchronizing iCal to all my devices, so that's a no-brainer. iTunes and iSync take care of that flawlessly, even without me asking, for a couple of months already. It's just that I wasn't really using iCal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The challenge is in getting Google Calendar to sync with iCal. There are a &lt;a href="http://www.twistermc.com/blog/2007/06/28/sync-ical-google">couple of solutions&lt;/a> to do this, and I choose to give BusySync and Spanning Sync a try, because these feel most suited to my wishes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BusySync&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first program I tried was &lt;a href="http://www.busymac.com/">BusySync&lt;/a>. It's a bit bloated for what I wanted to do with it, but it's pricing model is nice, $25 for a license. I downloaded the trail and without reading the manual (because I think good software does not really need one) I tried to sync 2 existing calendars, one in iCal and one in Google Calendar.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I immediately screwed up all my calendars, 3 times in a row. This did not feel good. BusySync has a way too complex user interface, too many features, and has one very big flaw: It can not sync an existing Google Calendar into an existing iCal calendar (at least, I didn't get how to do that). It is not clear about what it's doing and the whole &amp;quot;publish/subscribe&amp;quot; thing confuses me because I don't want to do either. I want to &lt;em>Synchronize both ways&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BusySync is trying to be the all-in-one solution for sharing calendars with Google, your friends, the neighbours dog, and back. It's more like a &amp;quot;Calendar Server&amp;quot; kind of application which feels like it has to be online, all the time. This may be fun for the tweak-freaks out there, but it sure was not solving my problem in an easy and elegant way. So, BusySync was quickly uninstalled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>SpanningSync&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much less bloated, &lt;a href="http://spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync&lt;/a> is a piece of software that only tries to solve 1 problem, and tries to solve it good. Spannig Sync can only do one thing, and that is synchronize Google Calendars with iCal calendars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Immediately after installing, I entered my Google acount data, and Spanning Sync fetches the Calendar list from Google. It then asks which iCal calendar I want to sync with which Google Calendar. Nice. Within 3 minutes, I had all (existing) Google Calendars synced with my (existing) iCal calendars. Flawlessly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then I tried turning on the &lt;a href="http://www.macobserver.com/tip/2007/01/29.1.shtml">birthday feature of iCal&lt;/a>, and sync that to a new Google calendar. Spanning Sync politely warns me that this Calendar is not editable, and changes in it's Google counter part will not result in changes in iCal. Great, that's the kind of warnings I can live with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After synchronizing, I renamed my Google Birthday calendar to add the words &amp;quot;Read Only&amp;quot;, so I would not make the mistake of adding appointments there. Spanning Sync has no trouble with renamed Google Calendars. It recognizes them by a hidden unique identifier. Rename as you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can see who has won the competition for me, hands down. Spanning Sync does a really nice job in synchronizing my calendars. The only downside is it's strange pricing strategy. You can use Spanning Sync for a year for $25. Or, you can buy an unlimited license, which will set you back $65.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because I returned to my FiloFax nearly every time I tried to &amp;quot;go digital&amp;quot;, I think I'll pay for a yearly license en see where it all ends.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The showdown&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my case Spanning Sync &amp;quot;just works&amp;quot; and in the end, that's what counts. I haven't touched the Spanning Sync preference pane for a few days, and it is still synchronizing nicely. My phone is also &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/04/27/homezone-more-seemless-sync/">synchronizing nicely&lt;/a>, so I really feel that the calendar is there for me, in stead of the &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/remember-the-milk-review/#more-263">other way around&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the top of my head, here are a few thoughts when comparing BusySync and Spanning Sync next to eachother:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >BusySyncSpanning Sync&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Multi-purpose, all-in-one, lots of bells and whistles
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Single purpose, simple user interface
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Publish/Subscribe model
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Two-way synchronization
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Can not sync existing Calendars
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Can sync existing Calendars
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >Cheap, simple license
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Strange yearly license
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td >$25
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >$25 a year, or $65 for an unlimited license
&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>For now, it's my Nokia 6300, iCal, Google Calendar and Spanning sync for me. But maybe, in a few weeks, you'll read hwo lovely my FiloFax really is. It doesn't need batteries, is crash-proof and allways-on. :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Get an Onscreen Keyboard in OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/04/29/get-an-onscreen-keyboard-in-osx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Apr 2008 20:38:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/04/29/get-an-onscreen-keyboard-in-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Always forgetting how to do accents on characters, or where the euro sign (€) is? Use the on-screen keyboard and see where the special characters are while holdin down the option key, or the shift-option combination.

&lt;p>In my last post, I wrote about how I got &lt;a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">HomeZone&lt;/a> to detect my bluetooth phone, and automatically start iSync. While I was playing with it, I noticed how HomeZone opens the Address book application and iSync, and doesn't close them. To make it more seemless, I used a script I found at &lt;a href="http://www.technocrat.ca/?p=44">The Technocrat&lt;/a> to start and stop iSync without interfering with your work. Here's how I did that.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->First, I opened the script editor and typed the following script into it (slightly modified from the one at Technocrat):
&lt;pre>&lt;code>tell application &amp;quot;Finder&amp;quot;
set iSyncRunning to (number of items in
(processes whose name is &amp;quot;iSync&amp;quot;) is greater than 0)
tell application &amp;quot;iSync&amp;quot;
if last sync is less than ((current date) - 120) then
synchronize
end if
end tell
tell application &amp;quot;iSync&amp;quot;
repeat while (syncing is true)
delay 1
end repeat
if iSyncRunning is not true then
quit
end if
end tell
end tell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Then, I saved this script as an application called &amp;quot;iSyncNow.app&amp;quot; . On the save dialog, make sure that &amp;quot;keep running&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;show on screen&amp;quot; are NOT thicked, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-9.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-9.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, open the HomeZone preferences and configure HomeZone to run this application when your phone is in range. My configuration looks as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-10.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-10.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this simple little trick, my Mac Mini has become a lot cooler. When I approach the computer, I see the iSync logo appear in the dock, it bounces a few times, and then it dissapears. My phone is now always synchronized with my iCal, without popups or manual actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please note that the script prevents iSync to synchronize if the last synchronization was less than 2 minutes (120 seconds) ago. You can adjust this by editting the &amp;quot;120&amp;quot; in the applescript to any number of seconds you like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have fun!

&lt;p>Recently, I installed &lt;a href="http://www.azarhi.com/Projects/DSW/index.php">&amp;quot;Do Something When&amp;quot;&lt;/a> and use it to start rsync scripts when I plug in certain USB devices. By doing this, every time I plug in my USB memory stick containing my &lt;a href="http://fpx.de/fp/Software/Gorilla/">Password Gorilla&lt;/a> password databases, it gets backed up (Apple style, with timestamps). Needless to say, it then gets backed up by TimeMachine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-8.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-8.png" alt="">
&lt;/a>I also needed this hands-off approach for synchronizing my iCal calendar with my new Nokia 6300 phone. Enter &lt;a href="http://metaquark.de/homezone/">Homezone&lt;/a>, a very cool app that can detect if a certain Bluetooth device is in range, and start iSync. It can also lock and unlock your screen when your phone is in or out of range, respectively. I did find some buttons looking funny when running it in Leopard, but it does work fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next up: a review between Busy Sync and Spanning Sync for synchronizing iCal with Google Calendar.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSX 10.5.2 Solved SMB problems (for me)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/03/16/1052-solved-smb-problems-for-me/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Mar 2008 20:47:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/03/16/1052-solved-smb-problems-for-me/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/11/16/osx-1051-update-still-smb-problems/">previous post&lt;/a> on this blog, I indicated that the 10.5.1. update of Apple's OSX did not fix my network and SMB problems with my Iomega drive. In the comments underneath, some readers kindly pointed out that &lt;a href="http://download.iomega.com/english/storcenter_home_firmware-k104w11.bin">Iomega's K104w11 Firmware update&lt;/a> is available for the Iomega drive I have. Now that 10.5.2 is out, I reconnected the Iomega drive to my network. And suddenly the world changed...&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I didn't upgrade the drive, because I thought that was rediculous. It works with Windows, it works with Tiger, why shouldn't it work with Leopard? Right now I'm glad that I didn't go through the trouble of upgrading my drive:
&lt;p>With the OSX release 10.5.2, my Iomega drive is accesable, and I can drag files on and off as I like.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have created a &amp;quot;sparse bundle&amp;quot; disk image on the drive, so that I can copy files onto it which are bigger than 4GB, and have (very very) long names. So it's finally there: A network mounted 500GB HPS+ partition to which I can backup my backups using an rsync script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that everything works, I might even be tempted to do that Iomega software upgrade, but then again: &amp;quot;if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next thing on my list to find out: What if I upgraded my Tiger fileserver to Leopard, and had TimeMachine running there. Could I rsync the TimeMachine disk to an off-site location without sending the double-hardlinked files twice?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Time Machine to the Rescue</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/02/21/time-machine-to-the-rescue/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Feb 2008 20:54:07 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/02/21/time-machine-to-the-rescue/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Hi, I just wanted to share with you that I actually recovered a mail item which I had written in Thunderbird for Windows with Time Machine. Yes, Apple's &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/backup-guru-give-me-a-break/">Time Machine&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->At work, we use Windows XP machines. Because I hate to wait 4 weeks for my mail program to load, I use [Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/nl/products/thunderbird/). When I'm on the road, I ocasionally use webmail access, so I have Thunderbird setup so that it connects to the mailserver using [IMAP](http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol). By doing this, my mail is always on the mail server.
&lt;p>Last week I saved a Draft mail containing some bugs in an application. My intention was to update this mail all week with new bugs, and send it out by the end of the week so that the reciever had a neat little list. By the end of the week however, I noticed that my Drafts folder was containing all kinds of old mail, and I decided to clean it out by &amp;quot;Crtl-A&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Delete&amp;quot;. I went home with an empty Drafts folder, not realizing I had also deleted the Draft mail with the list of bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By Sunday, I decided to send out the mail with the list of Bugs, and before I touched a computer it had hit me: I had deleted all my drafts! I sat down behind my trusty Mac Mini, settled on re-typing the whole list, but then I had a brilliant idea. My Apple runs Leopard, and the Mail program also connects through IMAP to the mailserver at work. So without me noticing, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail.html">Mail.app&lt;/a> had been fetching my mail all week, and Time Machine had been making backups all week. So I navigated to the &amp;quot;Drafts&amp;quot; folder, pressed the Time Machine icon, and 2 simple mouseclicks later I had found and restored that email I deleted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I sent it out and needless to say I am a very happy camper. Today was a bit less succesful, I forgot to sleep my Apple so Mail.app was periodically fetching my mail. At work, Thunderbird disconnects when that happens so I was constantly re-connecting while reading and writing mail. Oh well, at least everything is backed up :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Macworld 2008 thin as air</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/01/17/macworld-2008-thin-as-air/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2008 20:59:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/01/17/macworld-2008-thin-as-air/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Hi, I've read the writeups on Steve's keynote this year, and listened to some podcasts of people who were in the audience. Personally I'm a bit dissapointed by the features introduced at this Macworld. Surely it's hard to live up to the ever rising expectations every year, but I do have some comments to make on the introduced products.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->**TimeCapsule**
&lt;p>This is the worst product Apple has introduced in years. Not that it's crappy hardware or a lousy idea, but the way they are artificially forcing you to buy their $299 500GB harddrive (0r $499 for the 1TB version) in stead of the 100's of readily available, $150 to $200 cheap ethernet connected harddrives out there which would perfectly perform this task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Quick tip: Should you have an Ethernet connected FAT32 drive on which you want timemachine to run, create a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_disk_image">sparse disk image&lt;/a> on that disk (no need to commandline, can also be done with the disk utility). A sparse disk image is effectively a DMG file in 8MB chunks. You can mount that DMG file and have a network connected (strong encrypted if you like), HFS+ journalled drive. After the &lt;a href="http://andreas.louca.org/2007/11/10/time-machine-and-network-drives/">Timemachine network trick&lt;/a>, you're probably good to go at no cost at all. The only difference is that you can't connect your printer to that drive. Well I have my Airport extreme for that, which also streams audio to my stereo.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Macbook air&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Very cool looking laptop with lots of potential for journalists and the occasional &lt;a href="http://www.ijustine.tv/">life blogger&lt;/a>, but I have some doubts about the intended audience. The most obvious is the lack of a CD/DVD drive. This is not a big problem for most users, and with the added tools to connect to any DVD drive on a remote Windows or Apple machine it will not be as big as a problem as one would think. For my wife this is a no-go, she watches DVD's on her laptop, so she's not getting this Macbook air anytime soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My next problem is the configuration options. The cheap model is a 1.3GHz machine, 2GB memory and 80GB Harddrive. It is priced at $1799, which is pretty steep compared to a normal Macbook. For $700 less, you can get a 2.0GHz macbook with a combo drive, which is much nicer in my opinion. Should you want the Macbook air and have a heftier processor, you're in for a surprise. The 1.8GHz model (still not as fast as the cheapest macbook) is priced at a staggering $3098! This is not because of the processor, but it contains a 64GB flash-based harddrive. Less storage space, but more battery life and crash-resistance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with the 1.8GHz model of the Macbook air is that you effectively get a smaller harddrive, a marginally better processor, for $3098. Compared to that, for $2799, you can get the 17&amp;quot; Macbook pro at 2.4 GHz, with a superdrive. I know what I would get. Additionaly, the 64GB flash-based drive has a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_state_disk#Disadvantages">limited amount of write-cycles&lt;/a>. This means that the solid state drive will probably wear out faster than any cheap traditional HD in the market. Based on the write cycles, a normal HD will likely last 5 times longer than a flash-based disk under the same circumstances.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you need a really thin laptop with good battery life for simple word processing, or simply something to match your gucci wardrobe and your &lt;a href="http://www.owensworld.com/funnyimages/files/I_beat_anorexia_big.jpg">perfect figure&lt;/a>, get the Macbook air. If you need anything marginally better, go for the normal macbook, which is still in my opinion the best value for money and a darn cool, acceptably thin and very portable laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For me, the Macbook air is a no-go even if it was priced at $1000. Why? **IT HAS NO ETHERNET!**What were they thinking? Many companies have wired-only policies because of security and troughput reasons. This means you can't take your Macbook air to the office for the occasional showing off. It's helpless in a wired-only environment. No DVD, and no means of connecting to the network?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the Macbook air becomes a succes, Apple is clearly into some voodoo-market-magic because I don't get it. It also doesn't have Audio in, to put off the mobile podcasters or radio journalists out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Apple TV&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &amp;quot;all new&amp;quot; software for the Apple TV is very cool for people who already own an Apple TV. It looks like a big improvement, and not needing a PC or Mac is a step in the right direction. No need to explain &amp;quot;syncing&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;connecting&amp;quot; to newcommers, just plug and play. Nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The missing thing here is that they could have chosen to make the Apple TV the TimeCapsule. It has a harddrive, USB ports, and wifi. Why do I need another machine with anothe power brick if I have a harddisk onderneath my TV which is doing nothing 80% of it's time? Selling a 1TB Apple TV with a smart disk usage policy would make much more sense to me. As an added benefit, people who are looking for a backup solution get sucked into the &amp;quot;Movie Rentals&amp;quot; scheme on the go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>One missing thing:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The iPhone. It was mentioned, but still I was expecting 2 major announcements. The first, and most obvious announcement would be a 16 or 32 GB model. This was anticipated to happen for over a year now, but it didn't. I think it's not that big of a deal because I have a 8GB nano and it stores more than enough music to listen to in between syncs. Just use &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/08/01/ipod-synchronization-techniques/">really smart playlists&lt;/a> and iTunes will take care of it for you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The second thing I missed was the introduction of the iPhone in more European countries. Hello Apple, Europe doesn't consist of Great Brittain, France and Germany alone! Over here in the Netherlands, a lot of people have hacked grey import iPhones because they are dying to buy one, but can't get it legally. Maybe Apple thinks it's done beccause they reached their targets, but I think they are missing out on a big market of wealthy (west-) European consumers easily wanting to pay for the legal version of the iPhone, no matter which provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To top that, the free software update for the iPhone will cost $20 dollars for iPod touch owners, while new iPod touch's will have that included for free. I wonder what &amp;quot;marketing genius&amp;quot; is behind that. It almost looks like Steve has been on a year's vacation, leaving business to somebody else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just noticed that the complete video of the keynote is online at &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtv/keynote/&lt;/a>. Have fun!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Edit:  I see that there is an USB Ethernet adapter and an external DVD drive available as options to the Macbook air. But still, I think the ethernet port should be in there, I don't want to have to carry all kinds of adapters with my Macbook.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Easy Image Resizing in OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/31/easy-image-resizing-in-osx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Dec 2007 16:24:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/31/easy-image-resizing-in-osx/</guid><description>

Give me a break</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/11/backup-guru-give-me-a-break/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Dec 2007 21:27:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/11/backup-guru-give-me-a-break/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today I listened to a podcast called &lt;a href="http://formaceyesonly.blogspot.com/">&amp;quot;For Mac Eyes Only&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, in which people were complaining about how &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_%28Apple_software%29">Time Machine&lt;/a> does not work &amp;quot;the way they want it to&amp;quot;. I think this is utter crap, and I will explain why.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->To start off, I think I am safe to say that 99% of the people complaining about Time Machine's behaviour did not do backups of any kind at all, until Time Machine came along and "ruined their backup scheme".
&lt;p>Because of my work as a software engineer, people tend to consult me with their PC/Mac problems. More than once, these problems concern lost files, and no backup whatsoever. I think that in the past 10 years of my life, I have only spoken to 2 people who had an actual working automated backup schedule/scheme. Maybe 3 people made occasional backups to CD, of which 1 painfully discovered that CD's don't last forever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The copy-cat complainers about Time Machine, are easily put off by the question &amp;quot;What did you backups with before today?&amp;quot;. Usually this question results in stuttering and a lot of &amp;quot;uhhhmm&amp;quot;s and then some vague excuse about forgetting to buy CD's and what a hassle manual backups are. These people need to loose more data to understand the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, there are the &amp;quot;techies&amp;quot; who claim that Time Machine is technically inferior, lacks intricate timing and retentioning schemes, and that it's not an &amp;quot;off site&amp;quot; backup. I'll try to answer some of those questions because I think Time Machine is absolutely the best thing that has hapenned to the computing industry in decades since the introduction of OSX.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine can not be scheduled&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Totally true. And that's exactly a good thing. The Time Machine scheduling is one backup every hour. This is way better than any of the companies I have ever worked at, and way better than any of the client companies I worked for. Servers are usually backed up once a day. With Time Machine, you will not loose more than 1 hour of work, which is amazing by industry standards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Designing your own backup schedule to &amp;quot;not interfere with your working hours&amp;quot; will make it more likely that your backup will not run at all, or will run immediately when you turn on the computer because it missed a slot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine does not do block-level backups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many commercial backup programs can do block-level backups. This means that they are backing up only those parts of your files that are modified. Because these blocks need to be reconstructed into files when restoring them, you'll need the proprietary software to make a restore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With Time Machine, a changed file gets backed up entirely. Although this will cost a bit more room on the backup disk, it gives you the option to take the backup disk to another computer, mount it and search for files in your backup tree. A &amp;quot;restore&amp;quot; is nothing more than a drag-and-drop of the file to any computer you like. Not depending on Time Machine, you can restore files from your Leopard machine to any machine capable of reading your USB drive!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine will not create bootable backups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And that's a good thing too. People tend to be lazy. Suppose Time Machine made a bootable image of your harddrive. This would mean that as soon as you crash your drive, you can boot into your backup drive and carry on with your work. By doing that, you no longer have a backup process in place for the new work you are doing. Because a system restore is a drag, you'll continue to work from the backup drive, up until the point that you crash that one too, and realize that you have no backup of your backup drive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A complete system restore from a Time Machine backup is as simple as putting in the Leopard DVD, boot, and tell the installer to do a restore. It will install a fresh OS, and then restore all of your files, up until the point that you can no longer tell that you did a new install. From your mail, to your bookmarks, to even the locations of the icons of your desktop will be the same as you left it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The need for a bootable backup is very rare. Most of the time you'll use Time Machine to restore that one file, mail or photo you accidentally deleted. That's what it does the best.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Time Machine backups aren't &amp;quot;off-site&amp;quot; backups&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>No, Time Machine does not place your backups on a disk somewhere in India. If you'd like to do that, I'd recommend writing an rsync script and sync to a remotely mounted DMG file over a secure network connection. Time Machine is not meant for saving you when your house burns down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That having said, it is expected that Apple will re-implement the backup-to-network-drive feature of Time Machine, and by doing that, your backup can be anywhere on your network, and that enables you to do interesting things...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>I can't explain backups to my aunt Bessie&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-2.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-2.thumbnail.png" alt="Time Machine Settings">
&lt;/a>Now that is just plain nonsense. There is almost no user interface to Time Machine. Making Time Machine work actually requires nothing more than plugging in a drive, and clicking &amp;quot;yes&amp;quot; in the dialog window that pops up, asking you if you'd like to use this drive as a backup drive. For the non-believers, you can see the Time Machine settings pane at the right. Yes, that's right, it has an on-off switch. Complex, no?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not being a computer wizzard, your aunt Bessie has probably lost or misplaced a file more than once, maybe even up to the point that she's actualy afraid to use the computer because &amp;quot;it looses her files&amp;quot;. Besides learning her to use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software)">spotlight&lt;/a>, you can show how Time Machine can easily be used to restore that file for her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In stead of complaining about the bits that actually make Time Machine a good backup system in the first place, get people to do backups! Even if it isn't by using Time Machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, one last time:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shut-up-and-back-up-">**Shut up and back up! **&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>(And for professionals in the fiels there is an additional excercise: &lt;strong>Do a restore test every now and then!&lt;/strong> You'll be surprised at how much data you can not recover from your intricate full/incremental tape-cycling high-tech backup plan.)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hidden "Get a Mac" ads</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/02/hidden-get-a-mac-ads/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2007 16:27:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/02/hidden-get-a-mac-ads/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Last week, I hapily installed OSX 10.5 (Leopard) on my trusty Mac Mini. The upgrade from Tiger went without a hitch, and the system even got a bit &amp;quot;snappier&amp;quot;. For a week, I had no major issues with Leopard. The Dock dissapeared once, and I had a non-reacting keyboard once when waking from sleep mode. Other than that I am a happy Leopard user.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Up until a few das ago, when I tried to access my newly acquired 500GB &lt;a href="http://www.iomega.com/direct/products/detail.jsp?PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=51400371&amp;amp;FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=31699021&amp;amp;ASSORTMENT%3C%3East_id=26890319&amp;amp;bmUID=1195162566206">Iomega Network Storage&lt;/a>. The Iomega drive is a network connected drive, formatted as FAT32, and accessible through the samba (SMB://) protocol. With Leopard, I could see the drive in the network, and I could double click on it's shares, but when (if) the share connected, I could not drag files onto it, or see what is on the disk. Unmounting takes ages, and sometimes requires me to &amp;quot;killall -9 Finder&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I browsed the net and found quite a few people on forums discussing the same problem. Luckaly, Apple also had payed attention, and put out an update, which I installed just a few minutes ago. Sad thing is, that this update does not solve my problem (yes, that's Dutch you're reading):
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-3.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.png" alt="Upload to Samba Share problem">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I tried all tips I could find in the forums:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Connect using the IP address, rather than the network name
* Change the group of the device (WORKGROUP changed to NOTIT)
* Remove any non-alphabetical characters from paswords
* Remove passwords alltogether
* Connect using CIFS:// in stead of SMB://
* Any combination of the above
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>After previous experience with Apple products I seriously began doubting the samba implementation of the Iomega drive. So I tried some things on the Iomega drive, amongst which were:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * installing a (wrong) firmware update, which almost bricked it.
* Resetting to factory defaults
* Erasing Mac sidecar or meta files (the .DS ones)
* Formatting the drive completely
* Unsetting and setting passwords
* Changing share names to lowercase
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>But still, nothing. Leopard will not properly access this drive. Funny thing is, that when I try to connect to the Iomega drive from my other Mac, which runs Tiger, it works flawlessly. And I can also connect to that same drive from a Windows machine. This makes it clearly a Leopard problem to me, and one that still needs to be fixed, despite the speedy update issued by Apple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can we have another fix please, Apple? I can't reach my remote rsynced backups until you do...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tips for European Apple customers</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/11/03/tips-for-european-apple-customers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2007 22:06:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/11/03/tips-for-european-apple-customers/</guid><description>
&lt;p>For me as a european consumer, the low Dollar (or: high Euro) is a good thing. Particularly when travelling to the U.S., or buying American consumer electronics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Apple, as a big company with complete control over it's retail prices, the low Dollar (or: high Euro) is a good thing. Particularly when the conversion rates sneak up on the consumers and you &amp;quot;forget&amp;quot; to adjust your 1-to-1 Euro-to-Dollar conversion in your stores. Time to wake up the European Apple consumers.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->So how good is the Euro to Dollar converison rate for Apple? At the time of writing, €1.00 equals $1.4443. Comparing actual product prices between the online [U.S. Apple store](http://store.apple.com/) and the [Dutch Apple store](http://store.apple.com/Apple/WebObjects/nlstore.woa/), we can see how Apple's margin has increased with the exact 1.4443 conversion rate, baring the MacBook:

This is nice for Apple, but how can we make this nice for us consumers? Apple certainly is not going to lower it's prices in Europe, because Steve is in it for the money (prove me wrong soon, will you, Steve)? As far as I see, the European Apple consumer has 4 options:
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 1:&lt;/strong> Just buy the stuff you want, pay the Euro price and be happy with the value for money. Added bonus: you helped &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve&lt;/a> invest in future products, and maybe he'll &lt;a href="http://www.gadgetopia.com/post/2992">give away another mansion&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 2:&lt;/strong> Wait for the € to drop. This is a nice option if you were planning on an Apple free diet anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 3:&lt;/strong> Order the product you want in the U.S., and see if they'll send it to Europe. Maybe you'll have to have your product sent to a friend living in the U.S., and have him send it to you. Sometimes a hotel in which you stayed recently can be tricked into receiving and forwarding your package, as long as it's not to big. They'll charge your creditcard, so be carefull.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Option 4:&lt;/strong> Say you'd want the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">Mac Pro double core duo&lt;/a> (the cheapest Mac Pro model). Say you would like to buy that in the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/lincolnroad/week/20071028.html">Miami Apple Store&lt;/a> at Lincoln road. You could buy 2 oneway tickets at &lt;a href="http://www.exit-reizen.nl/reizen/vliegtickets/vliegtickets.html">exit-reizen&lt;/a>, which would set you back about €820.00 ($567.75). Because it's a long flight and you'd like to do some sight-seeing, you book 2 nights at the beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.secure-res.com/res/vn3/hchgs.aspx?hotelid=1599&amp;amp;roomid=6754&amp;amp;checkindate=11/10/2007&amp;amp;nights=2&amp;amp;rooms=1&amp;amp;trr=CFFFFFDA6F9EA1&amp;amp;adults=1&amp;amp;children=0&amp;amp;culture=1&amp;amp;culturename=nl-NL&amp;amp;site=SEO&amp;amp;wtpid=dcs5l6fkf00000omppulmk93o_3n3q">Clay hotel&lt;/a> at South Beach Miami at &amp;quot;Budget&amp;quot; rate, which totals to $172,89 including tax. During the trip, you spend about, say, $350.00 on cab fares, tips, food and souvenirs for the family. When you return home, you will have spent $1090.64 for the tip, including the purchase of your Mac Pro. At the current European price, &lt;em>you still have saved $19.66!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For iPods and other gadgets, I'd say option 1 and 3 are the best options, because I know you can't wait once you are an Apple addict. If you're planning on buying anything more expensive than an iMac, I would seriously consider option 4. You can get away with flying from Europe to Miami and back, picking it up yourself and still spending the same amount of money as you would have spent just picking it up in Amsterdam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How's that for Currency Market?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Headphone search</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/11/01/headphone-search/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Oct 2007 22:09:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/11/01/headphone-search/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Last week I've been complaining about the capped volume on the iPod nano and the inability to circumvent it. At the end of that very week, the iPod earbuds solved the problem for me by breaking down. The rubber rings started comming off, and the right speaker produced only 10% of the sound the left speaker was producing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided that this was enough reason to go looking for a nice set of in-ear headphones (earbuds) which would sound nice, and also improve on produced volume.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8110.jpg">&lt;!-- more -->&lt;img src="img_8110.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Apple ear-buds">
&lt;/a>After reading some reviews on in-ear headphones ranging from €40,- to €140,- I decided on the Apple in-ear headphones. Judging from reviews, these should compare to Sony Fontopia's, seal of surrounding noise and produce more sound. I payed the €40,- (that's $58,- at the current Dollar-to-Euro rate) and plugged them into the ipod, and my ears. Although I have pretty standard ears,  I couldn't get the Apple earbuds to fit comfortably. Apple provides 3 different size caps, of which the middle size was the least uncomfortable, and sealed off my ear properly. You can tell this by the pressure you feel in your ear when inserting the buds. The pressure will slowly go away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing I noticed is that by sealing off your earcanal, you can hear everything going on with the cords to the earbuds. Move your head, and you hear the cord move accross your clothes at a pretty uncomfortable volume. When playing music, don't move. The cord movement sounds will sometimes be louder than the music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sitting perfectly still and trying to judge the sound quality, I found that the Apple ear-buds are actually not good at all. Yes they provide lots of bass (which is a measure of quality nowadays I guess) but everything else is lacking. They sound flat, and miss the sharpness I expect from expensive earbuds. They are absolutely sounding worse than the standard earbuds that came with the iPod. If I had too choose between the two, I'd go for the standard iPod earphones in stead of the more expensive ear-buds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem with headphones in general and in-ear headphones in particular, is that you can't return them, because they can't be sold as new after you've jammed them in your ears. For that same reason I'm probably not going to sell them second hand, making these buds one of the more expensive pieces of trash in my bin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8111.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8111.thumbnail.jpg" alt="Sony earphones">
&lt;/a> Last weekend I passed through a hardware store to buy a new harddrive for my fileserver. Next to the cash register I found a pair of &lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/headphones-headsets/sony-mdr-e818lp/4505-6468_7-6900020.html">Sony MDR-E818LP&lt;/a> earphones for about €10,-. I bought them so that I could at least listen to music until I found a set of decent earphones.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And guess what? These sound great! They've got too much bass (probably a fashion thing), but that can be cured with the &amp;quot;less bass&amp;quot; setting on the iPod. By doing that, these earphones are the right thing for your iPod, at the right price. The sound is clear and crisp, and these buds produce a LOT more sound than the Apple ones. They don't seal off your ear, which I've come to beleive is a good thing, because of the cord-sound I described above. They come with a set of soft cushions which make for a comfortable fit, and I can wear them for hours at an end without getting sore ears.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get some of the €40,- spent on the Apple ear-buds back, I am using the Apple ear-bud carying case to store the Sony earphones in. The Sony's are worth it. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ofcourse this isn't the best set of earphones I've ever had. The old Sony fontopids that came with the first walkmans were absolutely the best in-ear headphones I've ever had. Comfortable fit, supple silicone cords, with red and blue stripes on the earpieces to mark right and left, but other than that perfectly symmetrical. Too bad they don't make those anymore.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="img_8113.jpg">&lt;img src="img_8113.jpg" alt="Sony MDR-CD770">
&lt;/a>The absolute best set of earphones I've ever had, and in fact still own after some odd 20 years, is a set of &lt;a href="http://www.epinions.com/content_6730518148">Sony MDR-CD770 Digital Reference&lt;/a> earphones. They (still) sound amazing, you feel like you can point out the location of every instrument in the band you're listening too, like they were in the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only problem with these are that they are big, expensive, and fragile. You won't be taking these with you when you're on vacation. They wouldn't survive the suitcase, and they're impossible when you are trying to lay your head down to sleep while listening to good music. Even if you did, you'd never wake up again, being strangled by the many meters of audio cable dangling off of your left ear.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if you're sitting at home on the couch, these will beat the * out of any soundsystem anyday, without annoying the neighbours. You'll be amazed at how good a high-bitrate AAC track sounds comming out of your iPod.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Happy Birthday!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/10/24/happy-birthday/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Oct 2007 20:36:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/10/24/happy-birthday/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I know you've been playing with your ultra-cool iPhones, but did you realize that it only is 6 years ago that Apple showed is the first iPod? It's amazing how fast technology advances nowadays. Today I read that 128GB flashdrives are not far away, so how about an 128GB iPhone, or even a MacBook with a solid state disk? We've got a nice future ahead...&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Meanwhile, you can watch Steve announce the first ever iPod, and notice the difference with the existing devices at that time. It's not strange that the iPod changed the way people listen to music.

&lt;p>Since Sony invented the walkman, the trains, trams and busses have been flooding with people wearing earphones. At first, they irritated everybody with the &amp;quot;ts...ts...ts...ts...ts...ts...ts...&amp;quot; sound comming out of their ears, and now, many early walkman owners are starting to show hearing problems. The European Union has stepped in to protect our ears, and have set some limits to how much sound a personal music device can produce.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In theory this is a terrific idea, but in practice, it doesn't work. Most manufacturers, like Apple are simply limiting the absolute maximum the device can use by measuring how loud a very loud mp3 plays at max volume. Then, they apply a software cap on the volume slider and that's that. As a side effect, people who like to listen to inheritly low-volume music (classical music or some talkshow podcasts) are very limited in where they can use this device.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I have an 8GB iPod nano myself (a.k.a. the "second generation"), and I am having trouble hearing the voices of a podcast when walking on the street. Most music has a sort-of-okay volume level, but this particular podcast I'm listening is very low on volume. Because it is a news podcast, I don't have the time, or patience, to manually manipulate the audio level of this podcast every single day before synchronizing it to my nano.
&lt;p>Today I found &lt;a href="http://gopod.free-go.net/">GoPod&lt;/a>, a tool which can remove the volume limit on many iPod models. This process is called &amp;quot;uncapping&amp;quot; the volume. I'm on an Intel mac, and even found someone who has compiled it &lt;a href="http://forum.insanelymac.com/index.php?showtopic=29548">for Intel Macs&lt;/a> (not available on the original site). After some fiddling with it, I found that it didn't work with my iPod nano. In a search on the internet, I found that the 2nd generation nanos were not supported by GoPod because the developers had not figured out how to do this for the 2nd generation. Aperantly it is not that simple.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When entering &lt;a href="http://www.ipodhacks.com/forums/showpost.php?p=47438&amp;amp;postcount=172">diagnostic mode&lt;/a>, you can make the iPod produce a really loud 1KHz tone, which shows that the nano is capable of much more than Apple is showing you. The writers of the GoPod software also found the regional strings interesting, and everybody started posting:&lt;/p>

So far, the regional codes have not helped solving the problem. The GoPod people are still working on a hack, meanwhile the only options you have are the following:
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Sell your European (capped) iPod and buy a new one from the US, make sure it is a US version. Maybe this is the moment to upgrade to that nice new generation nano :-)
2. Buy isolating in-ear headphones like the [Sony Fontopia](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR-EX51LP-Fontopia-Headphones/dp/B000095SB6), or the  [Sennheiser cx300,](http://www.sennheiser.nl/nl/icm_nl.nsf/root/500830) or the  [Shure E2c](http://www.shure.com/PersonalAudio/Products/Earphones/ESeries/us_pa_E2c_content). Isolating in-ear phones will cost you anywhere between 30 and 100 euros.
3. Buy a set of [earjams](http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/earjams) to turn your iPod earphones into in-ear earphones. The cheapest, but maybe also clumsiest solution.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Please note that the first option is the most expensive, but actually solves the output voltage problem some people are experiencing when connecting the iPod to other hardware like amplifiers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iPhone opens up to developers</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/10/18/iphone-opens-up-to-developers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2007 20:40:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/10/18/iphone-opens-up-to-developers/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Finally, the word is out. Apple (Steve) has announced at the &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/hotnews/">&amp;quot;hot news feed&amp;quot;&lt;/a> that the iPhone (and iPod touch) will be opened up to developers in February 2008. I think this is a wise decision. In stead of fighting developers, bricking phones and constantly being at the defense, the effort of Apple is much better put to use by working together with the (free, unpayed, expert-level, hours-on-end-concentrating, 24/7) programmers out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->
&lt;p>Steve wrote an open letter, which I'll quote here because you can not direct-link to posts in the &amp;quot;hot news&amp;quot; feed of Apple. On 17 October 2007 Steve wrote:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>&amp;quot;Third Party Applications on the iPhone&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Let me just say it: We want native third party applications on the iPhone, and we plan to have an SDK in developers’ hands in February. We are excited about creating a vibrant third party developer community around the iPhone and enabling hundreds of new applications for our users. With our revolutionary multi-touch interface, powerful hardware and advanced software architecture, we believe we have created the best mobile platform ever for developers.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>It will take until February to release an SDK because we’re trying to do two diametrically opposed things at once—provide an advanced and open platform to developers while at the same time protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, privacy attacks, etc. This is no easy task. Some claim that viruses and malware are not a problem on mobile phones—this is simply not true. There have been serious viruses on other mobile phones already, including some that silently spread from phone to phone over the cell network. As our phones become more powerful, these malicious programs will become more dangerous. And since the iPhone is the most advanced phone ever, it will be a highly visible target.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Some companies are already taking action. Nokia, for example, is not allowing any applications to be loaded onto some of their newest phones unless they have a digital signature that can be traced back to a known developer. While this makes such a phone less than “totally open,” we believe it is a step in the right direction. We are working on an advanced system which will offer developers broad access to natively program the iPhone’s amazing software platform while at the same time protecting users from malicious programs.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>We think a few months of patience now will be rewarded by many years of great third party applications running on safe and reliable iPhones.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Steve&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>P.S.: The SDK will also allow developers to create applications for iPod touch. [Oct 17, 2007]&amp;quot;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I really hope that Apple will also open up the iPod cables again, for a minute out there Apple seemed to be forgotten what their initial market strategy was (and should be): Compete by designing the best product.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I've found Microsoft products to be restrictive, as opposed to Apple's products being liberating. Microsoft makes me want to pirate stuff, Apple makes me want to pay for the great solution they have. Microsoft tries to charge you bigtime, and in return give you long serialnumbers, &amp;quot;authenticity checks&amp;quot;, and a lot of problems and bugs along with a piece of software that does not solve your problem or works like advertised (Vista, anyone?). Apple simply offers the best solution you could possibly imagine, (almost) without (noticable) copy restrictions, at a fair price. It will feel like money well spent, and almost always actually works &lt;em>better&lt;/em> than advertised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why all of a sudden Apple wants to be in the restrictive game is a complete mistery to me, and I hope they'll see the error of their ways soon...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AFP breaks when messing with your Public folder!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/10/04/afp-breaks-when-messing-with-your-public-folder/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Oct 2007 18:53:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/10/04/afp-breaks-when-messing-with-your-public-folder/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Hi, just a quick reminder to myself and users of the AFP protocol (Apple File Protocol) who are wondering why it is not working. For some strange reason, if you start messing (deleting) the &amp;quot;Public&amp;quot; folder of any user which is on the system providing the AFP share, you will break the AFP protocol.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I just deleted the Public folder from user A because I didn't want that user to have one. When I tried to connect to the server with user B, I got an AFP error. When I removed user A from the system, AFP worked again. I still have to figure out how to granulary disable drop boxes in the future, for now I'll leave them be I guess.
&lt;p>Why all this hassle? Renewed interest in remote backup I guess. I just found out that:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * You can easily tunnel AFP over SSH
* If you mount a remote 8GB AES encrypted DMG file, the file will not be transferred in its entirety over the network connection
* If you write 100kB into the mounted 8GB DMG, it does not write 8GB, but only 100kb+directory update.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>According to these observations, it should be able to make a 200GB DMG file on a remote machine, tunnel AFP over SSH and access it as a local disk with reaonable performance, even over an ADSL connection. This will pave the way for an automated rsync backup solution which could actually work, without special tooling or complex scripting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It can be done on Windows, too!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/09/11/it-can-be-done-on-windows-too/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2007 19:25:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/09/11/it-can-be-done-on-windows-too/</guid><description>
&lt;p>If you've ever had the &amp;quot;pleasure&amp;quot; of configuring and sharing a printer between Windows machines, you probably know how tedious it is to get one machine to send a print job to the printer connected to another machine. And don't even get me started on how to do that on a Linux machine, or any mix of these two systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Ever since I migrated from Windows to Mac, I had been avoiding the printer sharing thing. The Ethernet printerserver I bought in my PC days only came with Windows bloatware, so that was a no-go. The Epson Stylus 915 worked nicely, connected with USB to my Mac Mini, so I had no need to solve that problem. My wife however still has a Windows laptop, and every now and then she would send me documents by mail which I then would print for her. Not ideal, but it saved me the stress and trouble of struggling with Windows to get it to talk to a Mac printer.
&lt;p>Today I discovered that I had it all wrong. Apple makes this wonderful little (2MB) piece of software called &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/support/downloads/bonjourforwindows.html">Bonjour for Windows&lt;/a> which solved the whole printer sharing thing I had been putting off in about 6 mouseclicks! Share the printer on the Mac (about 2 clicks), download and install Bonjour on the Windows (about 2 clicks), and run the Printer wizzard that shows up (also 2 clicks). I had a Windows Testpage rolling out the printer before I knew it!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What a good friend pointed out on the phone was something I hadn't realized: &lt;em>&amp;quot;See, you can actually make good software running on Windows, and it doesn't have to come on 4 DVD's. It's just that they don't care&amp;quot;&lt;/em>. Well, Apple does care, and they did a brilliant job at it. Small package, simple interface, no fuss, just works, and is good looking too.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm very happy I did this, and in fact I'm going to print another testpage, just for the fun of it. On my Apple I am used to be able to edit video, audio, photo's and all at the same time. On Windows I'm glad I can print a testpage. See the difference? (for insiders: at work I'm glad to be able to receive a phonecall ;-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>iPod Synchronization techniques</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/08/01/ipod-synchronization-techniques/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Aug 2007 19:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/08/01/ipod-synchronization-techniques/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Wherever I go, my iPod nano goes. With a &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; disk like on the nano, it's sort of important to make sure you are carrying the tracks you'll want to hear. I have a couple of smart playlists, and leave the rest to iTunes. Syncing takes less than a minute, is fully automatic and I'm very happy with the results every time.&lt;!-- more -->&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_ipod-smart-playlists.jpg" alt="Smart Playlists">
Some people may be interested in how I organized this, so they can use some of these ideas themselves. On the left, you can see the smart playlists I use to fill my 8GB nano. I have placed these in a seperate folder to seperate them from all the other playlists I use to manage my iTunes collection with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there is the smart naming of the lists. Try to name your smart playlists so you can tell how they're built and what they contain. Looking at my lists, you can tell I only have 3 star rated songs and up on my iPod, unread books, and a seperate list containing tracks I haven't played or rated yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you can see my playlists are based on ratings. This is a personal choice, and only works on a good rating convention. To be able to build reliable lists based on ratings, try to conform yourself to rules. Mine are:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * **1 Star rating**: Never,ever play this track again. It sucks bigtime, or can't even be qualified as music. By doing this trick, you I effectively &amp;quot;delete&amp;quot; tracks right from the rating screen while playing a track. In iTunes I can later easily delete them when diskspace becomes a problem, but for how I keep them to keep my albums complete.
* **2 Star rating**: Not too good, don't play these too often. 2 star songs are currently not even transferred to my iPod.
* **3 Star rating**: This song is okay, I could listen to a radio station all day if it played songs with 3 star ratings
* **4 Star rating**: This is a good enough song to sit down to listen to. I can play it 2 times in a row without getting bored
* **5 Star rating**: If I had a single-song-ipod this track would be on it, and I would wear out the battery before putting another song on there. Effectively a &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot; song wherever I go.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_smart-3-star-radio-playlist.jpg">&lt;img src="o_smart-3-star-radio-playlist.jpg" alt="3 Star Radio playlist">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Translated: Rating is larger than 2 stars, limit to 2GB in size, select least recently played.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Above, you can see the 3 star radio trick. I found this idea on the web somewhere, and I liked it so I copied it, and added the size limitation. The playlist contains all 3 and more Stars rated songs, and is limited to 2 GB. Songs I played are swapped out during synchronization for ones I haven't heard for a while. The nice thing is that 4 Star rated songs in this list will also be in the 4 Star Radio list, but will only physically be on the iPod once. iTunes will never, ever physically put 2 instances of the same song on your iPod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is also the reason I can have 4 playlists of 2GB in size, plus some audiobooks and some other stuff (photo's) on my 8GB iPod. The 3, 4 and 5 star playlists don't add up 6 GB together, but far less because of the double tracks in there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_smart-never-played-or-rated-playlist.jpg">&lt;img src="o_smart-never-played-or-rated-playlist.jpg" alt="Never played or rated">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Translated: Playcount is 0, and rating is less than 1 star, limit to 2GB in size, randomly selected.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be able to listen to new songs in your library and rate them, you'll need a playlist like this one. It's called &amp;quot;Never played (2GB)&amp;quot; and contains songs I have never heard and never rated. I rate most songs on my iPod, because it's within reach when listening to music. I use iTunes to stream music to the living room, and I'm not at the screen then so it's harder to rate songs that way. Nice thing about this list and the rating scheme I use is that 1 or 2 star songs are efectively deleted from my iPod. They don't show up in the playlists, and during synchronisation they are physically removed from the iPod to never return again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_smart-audiobook-playlist.jpg">&lt;img src="o_smart-audiobook-playlist.jpg" alt="Audiobook playlist">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Translated: Genre is Audiobook, Playcount is 0, limit to 5 items, select least recently added.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then there are the audiobooks. I only actually have 1 I think, but this playlist makes sure I listen to my audiobooks in order of purchase. It puts the oldest 5 un&amp;quot;read&amp;quot; books on my iPod. Small disadvantage is that audiobooks need to have their genre set to &amp;quot;Audiobook&amp;quot; for this to work. I haven't found a trick to select audiobooks based on their extension (m4b) yet. Encoding type could work, but I also have AAC music tracks I bought in the iTunes store so the playlist would contain those aswell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next to the playlists above I have an important (dumb) playlist called &amp;quot;iPod musthaves&amp;quot;. This is a normal playlist, and any track I want on my iPod no matter what, I drag in there. I also have some lists called &amp;quot;blues&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;easy listening&amp;quot; but I don't use them that much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The only thing which is not really perfect is the way I handle genres. Hardrock is next to classical music rightnow. I tried to get the genres right, but found that the whole &amp;quot;genre&amp;quot; idea does not apply to modern music. &amp;quot;Bluesy Rock&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Rocky Blues&amp;quot; are overlapping genres, and are not usable to select tracks based on tempo or feeling. I have used &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/archive/2006/10/22/137730.aspx">Tangerine&lt;/a> to analyse the BPM of my tracks, but that still did not help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_no-more-genres.jpg">&lt;img src="o_no-more-genres.jpg" alt="No more Genres">
&lt;/a>To clean things up, I totally removed all crappy genre information from my library. Only a few very clear to identify songs with wierd genres I left to be able to find quicly. Proof is on the left. The information was indeed so crappy that I don't mis it a single day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What I do mis is the ability to find music grouped by &amp;quot;mood&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;energy&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;tempo&amp;quot;. In comes &lt;a href="http://www.crayonroom.com/moody.php">Moody (currently OSX only, Windows version in the making)&lt;/a>, a free iTunes plugin which allows to tag your tracks based on &amp;quot;Tempo&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Energy&amp;quot;. You can then build smart playlists based on tempo and mood ranges. I've tried this on 30 or so tracks and it looks very promising. I hope I can find the time to mood tag a larger portion of my iTunes library. Trouble is that I can't do that on my iPod.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To end this rather lengthy post, I can only encourage you to find your own &amp;quot;plan&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;system&amp;quot;, and translate that into smart playlists. This way iTunes &amp;quot;knows&amp;quot; what you want, and you'll be surprised about the great music you have in your library without knowing it. And if that's not enough, you can listen to your free podcasts for the daily news, music mixes or themed radio station.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>So you are on a nice forum, discussing stuff with people you don't even know, or even don't care to get to knowing. They're just there to exchange thoughts with, and you don't even care that he's called &amp;quot;g0d1s.4.f4g&amp;quot; (or worse), and you even don't know if he is a she. Then in comes this guy and actually uses a readable name, tells you who he is, and talks like he talks in real life. No shorthand, no l33t sp33k, just plain English with typo's, like any normal, sane person. Even worse, he claims to be a celebrity, wanting to talk to some of his fans without all the security, press and other stuff.It sounds too good to be true, but for Die Hard fans out there, &lt;a href="http://www.freezedriedmovies.com/blog/index.php?/archives/81-Is-Bruce-Willis-a-talkbacker.html">it has really happened!&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_ilove-apple-green.jpg">&lt;img src="o_ilove-apple-green.thumbnail.jpg" alt="I love my Apple">
&lt;/a>Lately Greenpeace has started a &lt;a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/apple/">campaign&lt;/a> against the usage of hazardous materials by Apple. The campain setup is friendly, nicely designed and urges Apple to choose materials which are less hazadous to the environment.As a spinoff of the Greenpeace campain all kinds of so called &amp;quot;journalists&amp;quot; have begun to put Apple on the &amp;quot;wrong end of the scale&amp;quot; of their &amp;quot;environment-o-meter&amp;quot;, and are happily writing doom articles about what will happen to your Karma if you buy any Apple product. But how environmentally unfriedly are Apple's computers really?&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Let's say you believe the hype, and avoid Apple like the plague because of it's [environmentally unfriendly plastics](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/agreenerapple/), it's [huge pricetag](http://kurafire.net/log/archive/2006/04/25/debunking-the-price-myth-apple-vs-dell) and the risk of becomming a brainwashed [cult member](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_%28religious_practice%29) worshipping Apple for te rest of your life.
&lt;p>So you buy a &lt;a href="http://www.shivaranjan.com/shivaupload/trashcanpc/musor_02.jpg">shiny new $800 PC&lt;/a> to run Vista, with that new 8 zillion transistor processor, dual &amp;quot;Energy Star&amp;quot; power supply and an &amp;quot;Energy Star&amp;quot; screen. When you turn the computer on, it starts to warm up your room with the 80 Watts it's consuming. When you really put it through it's paces, it consumes up to 150 Watts, or more if you bought that superduper video card which is more of an &amp;quot;audio card&amp;quot; when the fan starts blowing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a year of happy computing, your computer bogs down under the weight of all the &amp;quot;uninstalled&amp;quot; programs still on your drive. Vista 2 is released, and requires this all new Chipset to run, so you decide to buy a new PC. You give your old PC to your nephew, who totally turns it into an expensive $100 paper weight in 5 months, and it ends up in the trash because it can not be sold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Obviously your new PC is way cooler than your old one, so it runs way hotter and uses more enery than ever. So there you are. Lot's of money spent, lot's of energy wasted, and lots of plastic in the environment, all in under a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your mother is also in the market for a new computer to read your emails and watch your photographs. You try to push her into buying a &lt;a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/25/1061663718447.html">&amp;quot;man's computer&amp;quot;&lt;/a>, but before you know it she falls for the slick designs and smoothtalk sales at the Apple store. She buys an &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>She installs the heidonous toxic pastic bomb in her living room because &amp;quot;it looks lovely&amp;quot;. You put on your ear protection to turn it on, but your mother warns you that is already up and running. Yes that's right, you can't hear an Apple when it's on (and that goes for the fruit aswell). You don't believe her, and measure the &lt;a href="http://www.eworld.com/environment/energyefficiency/">power consumption&lt;/a>, which is less than half of the power of your PC, at comparabe system load. And the iMac has a built in screen to that, as well!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your mother uses the iMac for a year, and you stop by for your yearly 15 minute &amp;quot;tea-and-bisquits-with-mom&amp;quot; session only to discover that the iMac is still running as fast as last year, and is looking just as good as it did when it came out of the box. In fact, the next 2 yearly visits are the same. The iMac does not deteriorate, and judging by eBay, it holds it's value much longer than the average PC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each next version of the operating system hapilly runs on the &amp;quot;old hardware&amp;quot;, so your mother does not need to upgrade her hardware each time a new OS is released, apart from not needing to switch to the new OS anyway because it just works.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having read all this, let's see how PCs and Macs compare:&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >
&lt;p>PC
Mac&lt;/p>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
Life expectancy:
&lt;td valign="top" >1 year.
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >2 to 3 years.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
End of life:
&lt;td valign="top" >Ends up as worthless trash or power-gulping server.
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Gets sold to a happy new user for a good price.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
Power usage:
&lt;td valign="top" >More than 100 Watts (Pentium 4 PC without screen).
&lt;/td>
&lt;td valign="top" >Less than 50 Watts (Intel Core Duo Mac Mini without screen).
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
So which one is environmentally unfriendly I ask you? There are way more environmentally unfriendly PCs in the world, which use more energy and end up in the trash more often. I still remember how my electricity bill changed when I switched from PC to Mac, and how it is still running smoothly today.
&lt;p>Just a thought...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple and EMI follow up</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/04/03/apple-and-emi-follow-up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Apr 2007 21:16:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/04/03/apple-and-emi-follow-up/</guid><description>
&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/steve-jobs-gets-it/">previous post&lt;/a> I told you that Steve Jobs wants to provide DRM-free music through iTunes, but was held back by music companies. Steve must have had a few long and hard talks, because now EMI and Apple are teaming up to provide high quality &lt;a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/02/drm.free.music.on.itunes/">DRM-free tracks through the iTunes music store&lt;/a>, priced at $1.30. The same track, in a lower sound quality, with DRM costs $0.99. For &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/02/what-those-thirty-cents-buy-you/">30 cents&lt;/a>, you get a track you can actually use, with a higher bitrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time this could be a trick by Apple to get around the legal issues currently being discussed about iTunes music not being available to other players than the iPod. Smart eh?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bummer, back to Photoshop</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/03/06/bummer-back-to-photoshop/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Mar 2007 21:18:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/03/06/bummer-back-to-photoshop/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I bought Photoshop Elements 4 a while ago, but didn't use it much since I didn't like the userinterface (dissapearing menus when you click on the desktop and such). Then came Lightroom public beta, the Photoshop killer. I haven't touched Photoshop since I installed Lightroom. But now... the Lightroom beta testing period is over. Since I haven't got 300 Euros to &amp;quot;splurge&amp;quot; on Lightroom, I guess I'm forced to learn to use Photoshop to process my photos now. Oh well... Let's see how that goes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The DRM discussion that was &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/steve-jobs-gets-it/">started by Steve Jobs&lt;/a> is generating some interesting ripples in the music business pond.

&lt;p>Remember my rant on copy protection in the post about &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/archive/2007/01/25.aspx">opening iTunes to other players&lt;/a>? All the things record and movie companies tried the last few years has only encouraged people to rip, copy and distribute illegal media instead. It turns out that Steve Jobs also thinks that DRM is not the answer, according to bloomberg. Steve Jobs has sent a letter to the four largest music companies, in which he &lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;amp;sid=a_m4XNHva3IE&amp;amp;refer=home">Asks Music Labels To End Copyright Protection&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sure it might sound bad when you have serious record company stock options, but the idea is not so dumb as it sounds. For years, Apple software has been reasonably priced, and of good quality. You can buy it online without too much hassle. Result: There is not much illegal Mac software out there. This will surprise the Windows user, who is acustomed to running all kinds of illegal software, up until the point they are practically forced to continue to do so, because they have all their content stored in propriatary formats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I like Apple's way of doing things much more: Deliver good quality products, ask reasonable prices, and trust your users (up until a point ofcourse ;-). In return, Mac users are often more like &amp;quot;fans&amp;quot; than customers, because they don't feel like they've been &amp;quot;had&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think loosing the copy right protection and then lowering the prices on music is a good thing. The iTunes music store is an easy store to search music or other content in, and does not force millions of tracks onto you (like your friend with the 200GB music library on an USB disk does). Who cares if I have to pay a few cents for a track if I feel like iTunes has helped me find that track? The feeling shifts more to like &amp;quot;paying for the service&amp;quot; than &amp;quot;paying for the track&amp;quot; which is probably what we all look for. As an added value, we have the old &amp;quot;it's my product, I bought it&amp;quot; feeling back, where we can do with the content as we like because we payed for it. We are no longer restricted to stupid things as &amp;quot;you can listen this track only twice on your Zune before it will selfdestruct&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> More information and the response from Norway is &lt;a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/02/06/norway.responds.to.jobs/">online at MacNN&lt;/a>. Norway showing it does not understand iTunes at all, because you can configure iTunes to store the files at a location of your destination, which can ultimately be any (large enough) USB disk, which in turn can be a media player device :-) .&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Use iTunes with *ANY* mp3 player</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/02/01/use-itunes-with-any-mp3-player/</link><pubDate>Wed, 31 Jan 2007 21:29:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/02/01/use-itunes-with-any-mp3-player/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Many years ago, I bought an &lt;a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/Jens_of_Sweden_MP_100_256MB/4514-6490_7-30420028.html">iBead Jens of Sweden MP-100&lt;/a>. At the time I was a Windows/Linux user and everything was fine. Now that I'm a Mac user, syncing tracks to my trusty USB mp3 player is a bit harder. I had to copy tracks by hand, and when two tracks had the same title the copy would fail. THis was all very irritating. I am saving for an iPod nano, but until I get one I'm stuck with the USB copy tricks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But not anymore, 5 minutes ago I discovered &lt;a href="http://www.nesfield.co.uk/synctunes/">SyncTunes&lt;/a>, a free Mac OSX application which can sync iTunes playlists to &lt;strong>any&lt;/strong> drive as long as it's available on your desktop. This means that any drive that mounts as a removable drive (USB memory sticks, PDA's, Sony PSP's...) can be used to sync the playlist to. The only catch is that you have to make the playlist fit onto the drive (in size). This can be easily done by creating a smart playlist in iTunes which is limited in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tested syncing some of my playlists (through a size-limiting playlist) and it works like a charm. Size limiting playlists are also the thing to use if you do have an iPod, and want some control on how many space is used by pop music, and how many space is used by rock. I'm a happy camper now, and in no hurry to buy an iPod (but that &lt;a href="//store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore?family=iPodnano">8GB red nano&lt;/a> sure looks tempting).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Reboot...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/01/29/reboot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2007 21:05:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/01/29/reboot/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today the Mac OS Software update popped up, and warned that these updates would require a reboot (about 80% of the updates do not require a reboot). I have gotten so used to not having reboot and hangup troubles that I almost was surprised to see that I needed to reboot. I use my Mac mini for editting foto's, video, recording TV programs, streaming music, programming, mail, and the usual webbrowsing. It is so quiet and uses so little power that I only power off the screen, and leave the Mac on. I noticed that I have not turned it off for the past 20 days:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>&amp;lt;tt&amp;gt;rolf$ uptime
20:17 up 20 days, 23:37, 3 users, load averages: 0.20 0.26 0.20
&amp;lt;/tt&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Not bad for a workstation eh? Glad I bought a Mac, it was worth every penny. The other Mac mini I bought to replace my fileserver is also still worth every penny.Just thought I'd share some of my newly acquired Zen with you...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Opening iTunes to other players</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/01/25/opening-itunes-to-other-players/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jan 2007 21:08:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/01/25/opening-itunes-to-other-players/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Today I found an &lt;a href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articlenews.aspx?type=technologyNews&amp;amp;storyID=2007-01-25T155722Z_01_L25510487_RTRIDST_0_TECH-APPLE-ITUNES-NORWAY-DC.XML&amp;amp;WTmodLoc=TechInternet-C3-Technology-2">article about Norway suing Apple&lt;/a> because music bought in the iTunes store could not be played on a non-iPod music player. If Apple looses this legal attack, it would result in an even stranger digital rights management situation than we already have. &lt;!-- more -->First, let me tell you why I think the whole legal case would not be worth persuing anyway:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Music bought through iTunes is in the [AAC format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding#How_AAC_works), which is an open standard format. Any modern player is capable of playing AAC files. The &amp;quot;problem&amp;quot; lies in the way the songs are stored in an encrypted form invented by Apple, called [Fairplay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FairPlay). Fairplay resticts the way you use and play the file, but only very limited: You can play a Fairplay encrypted file on your iPod, on up to 3 (three) authorized computers, and (here it comes) can be **copied to a standard audio CD any number of times**. Since when is this called &amp;quot;limiting&amp;quot;?
2. Buying DRM music from iTunes clearly has limitations. Apple is not hiding this fact, as Microsoft is not hiding the fact that WMA has almost the same limitations. Suppose there was no workaround available and you had to play the music on your iPod, you still could not complain. You can almost describe it as not being able to play CD's on your record player. You bough a CD, not a vinyl record, and you knew beforehand that it was not compatible with your record player.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>That said, I think the root cause of these type of lawsuits is often overlooked. It's the way people think about intelectual property and the traditional ways of selling copies where the author received a substantial part of the profits. In a digital age like ours, there is no &amp;quot;physical product&amp;quot;, which makes it very easy for me to give a file I bought to just about an individual out there, without me loosing the original file. The copies of the file are all of the same superiour quality, so re-distributing them is very interesting to anyone wanting to exchange or &amp;quot;trade&amp;quot; music.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have allways thought of DRM of crippeling a file because people simply can not behave. The whole proces of crippeling audio and video files has just resulted in me doing the oposite of what the intent was. If I buy a DVD, I have to watch a few minutes of copyrights notices and commercials, without being able to skip them. If I rip it, and re-write it, these notices are gone, but I feel mistreated by the DVD company because I have to de-cripple my DVD's. This makes the ripped illegal copies much more interesting for me, because regardless of the price, I can just pop in the DVD, and watch the movie, like expected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Same goes for Audio, up to a certain point. When I buy music online, regardless if this is through the or &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/stores.aspx?lcid=809">any other WMA selling store&lt;/a>, the store dictates the way I use the audio file. As customer, I feel like I bought a file and I can do with it what I like. As store, they sell you the rights to listen te a recording in a restricted number of ways, a restricted number of times even. That's why I allways try to buy music on a normal audio CD. This gives me the ultimate solution to all problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. It is the original regording, in a non-lossy form. I can allways re-rip the audio in any bitrate I see fit for the purpose at hand.
2. I allways have the original and it will last for years as reliable backup. Storing it safely in a cupboard and never using (scratching) it, it will provide me with a 100% safe backup of my digital music library on my Mac, iPod, or USB memory stick player.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If it is not possible to get the music on a normal CD, I can allways resort to people who invent products like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymn_%28software%29">Hymn (Hear Your Music aNywhere&lt;/a> to remove the DRM for me. As long as I do not copy the file, I see no harm in doing this because the DRM is there to prevent me from doing things I would not easily do anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think crippeling digital content is not the way to protect their content. There will always be people finding methods around this. Furthermore, the prices are very much like the pricing of their physical counterparts, which makes fro very unatractive products. Why would I buy a lossy, digitally crippled version of an audio track I can have on a non-lossy CD for the same price (per track)? The real problem is not being able to proscecute violators of the different copyright acts in various countries. What you actually want to verify is that the user of the audio file has paid some money to the original artist(s). That's the only problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What if the stores selling these audio tracks just gave every song a serial number. No DRM, just a tracking number. The store can administrate which serial number was bought by whom. By doing this, officers at my door can just extract these ID's from my library, upload them to the store and see if I paid for them, or somebody else did. This will probably not be the case for 100% of my tracks (since somebody else could have bought it for me on another computer). To prevent overhead lets say that the law states that 80% of my bought songs should have been bought by myself. If more than 20% of my library is not accountable for, investigation is started and could result in me paying fines for every song in my library which is considered to be an &amp;quot;illegal copy&amp;quot;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The whole sales model needs to be reinvented, and I think DRM is not the way to go. It has been around for long time, and I have never been tempted enough to buy a track, nor were any of my friends. As music stores go, the iTunes store is about the only store I &lt;em>would&lt;/em> buy tunes from, because this guarantees me that they will be playable on my machine and my music player. Apple is very maticulate about the correct functioning of their hard and software, much more so than Microsoft or any other smack-together-a-WMA-music-store out there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Somebody should sue CD labels for producing CDs which can not be played on a computer for exactly the same reasons as in all these other lawsuits. I bought music, and the store has no right deciding when I can do what with it or how many times (no pun intended). I understand they don't like illegal copies, but they can not punish me for making illegal copies before actually doing so.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe music should just be free alltogether, and make it &amp;quot;donation-ware&amp;quot; or something alike. Most artists make more money in a single concert than all the years CD profits. You could see the CD as a commercial. Give it away for free, print the concert dates on it and make people go to your concert!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a way this is already what higher powers are doing for us. On every CD-writable I buy in the Netherlands, I pay a fee to &lt;a href="http://www.bumastemra.nl/en-US/Home.htm">buma-stemra&lt;/a>, because I could &lt;em>potentially&lt;/em> place (illegal) music on that CD. If I payed for it allready, then why not do it anyway? I have less and less problems with copying digital content with all these organisations charging fees and taxes for things I did not buy or am not intending to do. There was even a discussion going on about &lt;a href="http://www.portablegear.nl/nieuws/2/120/2533/Nederlands_belastingvoorstel_draait_MP3_de_nek_om.htm">adding mp3 taxes to harddisks&lt;/a> because you can place music in mp3 form on a harddisk. Is that sick or what?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I think the issue is covered by many others allready, and there are no new insights in this article. So I'll just return to my iTunes library, make a few backups and hope they'll never make playback of my tracks impossible...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>See the iPhone Demo</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/01/13/see-the-iphone-demo/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2007 21:26:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/01/13/see-the-iphone-demo/</guid><description>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_iphone-cingular.jpg">&lt;img src="o_iphone-cingular.thumbnail.jpg" alt="iPhone">
&lt;/a>I have been watching the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">Macworld 2007 keynote address&lt;/a> for the last 2 hours and all I can say is:...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jup, nothing. I am absolutely amazed by the way Apple has not only reinvented the phone (look ma, no keys!) but also the ipod (look ma, &lt;a href="http://www.steelskies.com/coverflow/">coverflow&lt;/a>!), and maybe the most overlooked, but they reinvented the mouse!!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A couple of months ago, I was amazed at this &lt;a href="http://ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=j_han&amp;amp;flashEnabled=1">new userinterface&lt;/a> Jeff Han presented . It was touchscreen based, and very intuitive. He amazed the crowds with it. At the time me and my collegues guessed that he must have had several computers working in parallel to be able to facilitate this. Now, Apple actually integrated it into the phone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think a phone without keys sucks, and you think your blackberry is a great device, please take a look at the keynote presentation, I think you will want one of these. If you are too busy to sit for 2 hours watching this amazing device, or even too busy to watch the shortened version (on the same page, as the keynote, above), I'll list some of the highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Large (and I mean LARGE) touch sensitive display all over the front of the phone
* ipod functionality, syncing not only your music, but also your photos, movies and contacts automagically between your Mac and your phone
* Runs [Mac OSX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/index.html), Apples operating system shipped with all macs. (Yes REALLY runs it)
* Full, 100% normal internet browsing using a new version of [Safari](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/) (told you it runs OSX, didn't I?)
* Full [Google maps](http://maps.google.nl/) integration (not a crippled mobile phone version), enabeling you to view maps and satelite images on your phone, and integrates with your phonebook and other applications. Lookup where an address is, or search for the nearest Starbucks and directly phone a store from within the Google map (demo in keynote).
* Full rich text IMAP and POP3 email client with very easy to use onscreen keyboard with error correction
* Tilt sensor to enable to view anything in landscape mode by just holding your phone horizontally, providing widescreen movie viewing!
* Gesture based user interface, allowing you to navigate through the phone and zoom in and out on practically anything
* Quad band phone using GSM + EDGE standard. Currently only shipping with [Cingular and AT&amp;amp;T](http://www.cingular.com/home/) and a [free Yahoo! imap](https://login.yahoo.com/config/mail?.intl=us) account. Technically possible to use in Europe using any GSM network provider, but I don't know how the Cingular contract looks for Europe.
* Built in WIFI and bluetooth technology to connect to the internet or any network, and a bluetooth headset, and it does that seemlesly
* Random access voicemail (tap on the voicemail you want to hear)
* Priced at $499 for a 4GB model, and $599 for an 8 GB model, available in June in US, end of 2007 in Europe, and 2008 in Japan.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_iphone_home.gif">&lt;img src="o_iphone_home.thumbnail.gif" alt="iPhone unlocked">
&lt;/a>My list could go on and on, but these are probably the highlights you were looking for. I've seen &lt;a href="http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs">Steve&lt;/a> using the iPhone, and the userinterface is a dream. If you own a Microsoft mouse with the &amp;quot;heavy scrollwheel&amp;quot; you will know what I mean when the iPhone scrolls through the lists by giving it a swing. Amazing to look at. The Core animation of OSX is in the phone, so everything tilts, swoops and zooms like on your desktop and it is really, really nice too look at.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My guess is that by doing this and patenting it, the next step Apple will take is reinvent the desktop userinterface. Have your screen built into your desk, throw your keyboard away and touch the screen! It has been done before, but after you've seen the keynote you will agree with me that Apple can do it right this time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been quite some time since I have been amazed by a product like this, although it will be a while before I own one because I'm afraid it will get stolen because of it's good looks. I'm afraid it will even push the iPod out of the market a little, and Zune will be dead and gone when the iPhone hits the market...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go and see the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/j47d52oo/event/">Macworld 2007 keynote address&lt;/a>, and see his Steveness improvise when his &amp;quot;Clicker's not working&amp;quot; just before he announces &amp;quot;Apple Computer Inc&amp;quot; is now going to be called just &amp;quot;Apple Inc&amp;quot;. Maybe Apple should ship this keynote on DVD. Seriously. Even if the only reason is seeing John Mayer perform &amp;quot;Gravity&amp;quot; live and unplugged at the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'll hold on to my &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=GOOG">Google&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://finance.google.com/finance?q=AAPL">Apple shares&lt;/a> for a while I guess...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>X for Vista...</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/12/17/x-for-vista/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2006 15:35:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/12/17/x-for-vista/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I recieved my &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/airportexpress/">Airport Express&lt;/a> last tuesday and had it installed as a wireless audio connection for my stereo in a couple of minutes as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Plug the Airport Express in a wall outlet.
2. (Temporarily) connect it to the network using an UTP cable
3. Run the Airport Administration utility (forget the wizzard, it will not allow you to setup the airport as a client).
4. Setup the Airport Express to connect to your existing network (which was WEP encrypted at that time)
5. Unplug the Airport Express, take it to the living room and plug it into an outlet, and connect it to the stereo (look ma, no wires!)
6. Select the airtunes to be used as speaker device in iTunes and you're all set
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;!-- more -->So far, so good. I've enjoyed listening to my mp3's in the living room for a few days. I can see my Mac mini from the couch, and I can read the frontrow screen with the nice cover art, and can control playback with the apple remote. I also noted that I can select to use the Airport Extreme as well as the speakers connected to the mac simultaniously. The music is actually synchronized, so there is no "echo" when playing music from both speaker sets. Nice!
&lt;p>Today I decided to upgrade the encryption of the access point in the living room to WPA2 (or WPA with AES Rijndael encryption and reloading key groups every 5 minutes for the nerds out there). My Linksys WAP45G supports this, as well as all the wifi hardware I currently own (I checked). Everything was converted to WPA2 pretty easy, until I came to my new shiny toy, the Airport Extreme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent this whole evening trying to get it connect as a client to the WPA2 network, but to no avail. Other people are reporting similar problems. It just sits there blinking it's amber light. Luckaly I have an ethernet cable available near the stereo (network everywhere! wohoo!) so I decided to give up and connect the Airport Extreme to the network by cable. So now everything is working again&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The disadvantage I have right now is that I can not use the Airport Extreme anywhere in the house without wires. I'm not downgrading my security for now, I hope Apple solves this problem in a future release of the Airport Express firmware. They are usually pretty fast with fixes so I'm not that worried (yet).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More info on WEP, WPA and WPA2 can be found on wikipedia at &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Access&lt;/a>. And NO, WPA2 is NOT easy to crack, like I read on some forums. Damned wisenose hoax-starting scriptkiddies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still not convinced? From an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">article about AES on Wikipedia&lt;/a>:
&lt;em>&amp;quot;The design and strength of all key lengths of the AES algorithm (i.e., 128, 192 and 256) are sufficient to protect classified information up to the SECRET level. TOP SECRET information will require use of either the 192 or 256 key lengths. The implementation of AES in products intended to protect national security systems and/or information must be reviewed and certified by NSA prior to their acquisition and use.&amp;quot;&lt;/em>
So there. AES with 192 bit keys are secure enough for TOP SECRET documents for the US governement. Secure enough for your home? I guess so!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sidestep: I noted this little &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; on my desktop on how to set up the mac mini fileserver . I guess I need to finish that, since it is very intresting to see how simple it is to setup a quiet, low power fileserver with versioned backups, CVS server and the added security of the OSX operating system, for just over 300 Euros. I hope you'll be able to read about it soon on this blog.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OSX: USB Fat32 drives trouble samba</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/09/26/osx-usb-fat32-drives-trouble-samba/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Sep 2006 14:55:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/09/26/osx-usb-fat32-drives-trouble-samba/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Okay, I found the answer to &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2006/09/25/samba-shares-and-usb-drives/">my problem&lt;/a>. Mounting an USB drive on OSX which is formatted as Fat32, will not behave nicely when being accessed through samba. Trying to start multiple copy processes simultaniously will cause seemingly random &amp;quot;file locked&amp;quot; errors. I just formatted the drive as HFS+, and the problem dissapeared. This is a screenshot you'd expect when copying, but I was very happy to see it just a minute ago:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_afbeelding-2.gif" alt="Multiple file copy jobs">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that I've cleared that problem, I can start working on the backup and virusscanning processes, and writing a nice &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; so you can do the same with your mac mini!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I should have done this right away like I planned. HFS+ is far better than Fat32 (journalled, auto-defragmenting, case preserving, and better in preserving file integrity).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Samba shares and USB drives</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/09/25/samba-shares-and-usb-drives/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Sep 2006 14:54:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/09/25/samba-shares-and-usb-drives/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I am very close to migrating the data on my bulky PC to my new Mac Mini fileserver and mounting the IDE drives in the USB drive brackets. Once I've done this, I will have the screenshots and data to write a nice &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; on using the Mac Mini as a file server. There is however one slight problem which could prove to be a showstopper...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Samba test 1: local directories.&lt;/strong>
I created a directory in the root of the HD in the mac mini, and made it R/W for everybody. Then, I used SharePoints to make it available to all password-less Guest users on the network (which happens to be the default Windows user for connecting to drives without asking for a password). All was well. I could access the share, and could copy as many files from as many machines imultaniously as I wanted.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Samba test 2: USB mounted volumes.&lt;/strong>
I mounted a HFS+ formatted USB disk to the Mac Mini, and made it available to the network in the same way as in test 1. Everything seemed to be working fine and as expected, but while running some tests I discovered a strange thing: I can only copy files onto the USB drive from 1 machine at a time, 1 file at a time. When starting a new copy while allready in the process of copying an older file, one or both copy jobs crashed with a &amp;quot;file in use&amp;quot; error.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am now trying to find out what is causing this problem. I have a firewire drive I can use to determine if it is the USB protocol or driver which is causing this problem, or if it is the fact that it is a mounted volume alltogether. If anybody has tips I'm glad to hear them. Meanwhile I'll be searching the web...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong>
Using a firewire drive does not solve the problem. I did find some articles on fast user switching which state that only 1 user can access pheripherals at a time. This seems to be related to this problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2&lt;/strong>
Creating a symlink to the mounted volume and sharing the link through samba will not change behaviour. I was expecting this, but tried anyway because it only costs 1 minute to test. Maybe a virtual drive would be an option. I can create virtual RAID disks in OSX, but I don't want my setup to be complex. This will add to the complexity when recovering from a sever crash. Simple, full and fast recovery from hardware problems is my top priority.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tryout Mac Mini as Fileserver</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/09/20/tryout-mac-mini-as-fileserver/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Sep 2006 14:51:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/09/20/tryout-mac-mini-as-fileserver/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The past 5 years (or more, I can't remember exactly) I have had a windows server which provided 4 &amp;quot;shares&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;network disks&amp;quot; to the users of my local network. Simplicity was it's power. All network users would connect with the default windows &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot; account to prevent complicated logon screens and forgetting of passwords. To prevent damage to files, all shares are read-only, except for one, where people can drop files. Only the administrator of the machine can move the files from the drop box into the different read-only shares. All files on the server were backed up twice a week to a different (physical) drive, and all drives were automatically virusscanned each day and on-access, and defragmented once a week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My dad is also using this server (we have a wifi bridge between our homes and yes, it is military grade encrypted). A few weeks ago we ran out of diskspace (bought new cameras :-). So we bought a 320GB drive. The old server with the passivly cooled 600MHz pentium 1 processor decided it didn't like the large drive so we had to upgrade the hardware. I built a new server from my old desktop PC, which was collecting dust because I am now a happy Mac user. When the new server was ready, it was much more noisy than the old one (more fans), and slurped 105 Watts while doing nothing, and up to 140 Watts under booting or serious disk/network access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just for fun, we also measured the power usage of my Mac Mini. It was using 40 Watt under heavy disk access, and only 20Watts when doing practically nothing. In sleep mode this even dropped to 3 Watts! This, plus the fact that the PC was producing so much heat that we actually started to worry about it catching on fire when placed inside a closet, convinced my dad to use a Mac Mini as a file server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next day, he called me to tell me he had bought a G4 Mac Mini to be used as a fileserver for around 300 Euros. I picked it up and re-installed OSX on it. This only took 30 minutes or so, and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised by the performance of the G4 in comparison with my Core duo Mac Mini with 2GB memory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tonight, I installed &lt;a href="http://hornware.com/sharepoints/">Sharepoints&lt;/a> on it, which is a utility to efectively edit the smb.conf file on your mac. I hooked up an USB disk, and got it running as a samba share in less than 5 minutes, complete with Windows Guest login. Just now, I also managed to make one of the 2 shares readonly, which prooves that the mac Mini can behave itself exectly as the PC server I had to the outside world. This would be great, if I give it the same network name nobody will even notice that their files are now served by a Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will try to mimic my fileserver completely soon (somewhere next week) and will post a complete description of what the original server did, and what I did to get the Mac Mini to replicate that behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now go buy your own Mac Mini G4 and some USB (or better: firewire) harddrives (with spindown capability!) and join me next week in building your mac Mini fileserver. Have a proper place and a proper backup for your files and photos!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Soon, your house will be free of PC's... :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>EyeTV Export, done right</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/08/23/eyetv-export-done-right/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Aug 2006 15:03:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/08/23/eyetv-export-done-right/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A while ago, I bought a &lt;a href="http://www.miglia.com/products/video/tvmax/index.html">Miglia TV max&lt;/a> for my Mac Mini. With it, you get &lt;a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=support_updates_eyetv2">EyeTV&lt;/a>, the PVR recording software. I was very happy using it, but I recently discovered that all exported MPG files are missing the last part. Arg!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a VERY serious bug. It also means that each and every recording I have archived on my external HD is crippled, so I can start all over with collecting series. Lucky as I am, each and every serie gets rerun after rerun on Dutch TV. They have many channels to fill, much commercials to sell and very little (interesting) new material to show.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->Since the endings weren't missing from the recordings as long as they were still part of EyeTV's library, I did a little bit of investigating. As it turns out, the original MPG recording can very easily be copied from the eyeTV archive. This saves you a (very) lengthy export process, and leaves you with a perfect MPG2 file. And yes, your edits are in there to, so no commercials!
&lt;p>What you need to do, is go to your &amp;quot;Documents&amp;quot; folder, and open the &amp;quot;EyeTV Archive&amp;quot; folder. Select a recording you wish to export (*.eyetv), and hold the &amp;quot;Ctrl&amp;quot; key while clicking it. Select &amp;quot;Show Contents&amp;quot; from the menu:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_afbeelding-6.gif" alt="Opening the package">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you have done that, you will see the mpg file in it's full glory, although with a wierd number as a filename:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_afbeelding-3-copy.gif" alt="Package contents">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can now just copy the mpg file to any location you like. The only downside is that you need to rename it manually. The upside is that this is the mpg as you left it after editting, in the same resolution, and it doesn't take ages to convert it to some stupid mp4 or mov file nobody supports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To view the mpg file you need an expensive quicktime version, or you can just view it with &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mplayerosx/">MPlayer OSX&lt;/a>, which will happily play MPG2 encoded files for you, without nagging about payments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now maybe if I can get my head around Folder Actions and Automator, I might just be able to create a folder which gets the mpg from an eyetv recording and automatically renames it. Suggestions anyone?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Apple WWDC 2006 Keynote Address problems?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/08/10/apple-wwdc-2006-keynote-address-problems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2006 15:08:56 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/08/10/apple-wwdc-2006-keynote-address-problems/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Trying to view his Steveness in the Apple WWDC 2006 Keynote addres? Me too, and haven't been lucky for 3 days in a row. I actually managed to view 3 minutes of distorted, half-audio presentation, but then it died, and has given me an error 400 ever since. It's not nice to see Apple not being able to cope with the demand. A bittorrent would be nice I guess.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my first edit of this post I thought I'd found a mirror, but it was an old keynote. Searching on, I found a terrific tip which solved the problem of not being able to view the keynote. It actually turns out it's the default Quicktime settings are causing the problems. Quicktime fetches the stream over UDP, which makes no guarantee over lost packets. You can set Quicktime to fetch the stream through http, which has a few advantages, such as losless transfer of data, and ability for proxy server to cache data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To set Quicktime to fetch the video accros http:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * Go to System Preferences
* Open Quicktime preferences from the system preferences screen
* Click on the &amp;quot;advanced&amp;quot; tab
* Choose &amp;quot;Custom&amp;quot; for transport setup
* In the window that pops up, choose the HTTP transport protocol
* Close the system preferences
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now go to the &lt;a href="http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/aug_2006/event/index.html">WWDC 2006 Keynote address page&lt;/a> and view the video. I just did, it worked fine, no dropped frames or audio.
Enjoy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>p.s. Tiger shipped for 80 euro's when it was released. If Leopard is anywhere close to that same price, it will be hard to find an operating system which gives you all this, with this quality, for this price. Professional grade OS, for the price of a SuSe distribution! I love Tiger, I know I'm going to love Leopard. Since I have my Mac, my Windows laptop (which was an expensive one I might add) is sitting in a corner of my desk, covered under a layer of dust. It's simply not good enough anymore. My Mac mini will beat it any day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nice Apple applications</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/07/11/nice-apple-applications/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2006 15:26:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/07/11/nice-apple-applications/</guid><description>

&lt;p>I really like iTunes. When you have 1 computer (an apple, that is ;-), and 1 place to store your music, it's all you'll ever need. It is easy to manage your music with, it puts your files in reasonably understandably locations (artist/album/track), has nice smart playlists and there are a lot of plugins available.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I also like to store my precious media at a different machine than my desktop. Since a desktop is more prone to "crashes", nearly allways caused by user error, it is not the place to keep your important or irreplacable files, like your family photo's. So I have a network. On this network, I have a server which contains my digital media (foto's and mp3's, mainly). The server is only used as storage location, does not run strange software, automatically backs up all files to a seperate harddisk, defragments drives and mails me when something goes wrong. Access to shares is restricted properly, guests can only read files, and there is one "incomming" share where people can read and write. Important files get moved to the read-only shares by an administrator user (me). This server has been up and running for over 4 years now, without a hickup, and with backups of at most 2 days old.
&lt;p>Being all organized, my iTunes library is also on this server. As long as I use 1 computer, with 1 instance of iTunes, all is well. But when I start up a different computer (the one in the living room) to listen to my music, things get ugly. The iTunes library is really designed to be managed by 1 iTunes instance. Changes made to my music library on one computer, can not be seen on the other. Even worse: it handles it terribly (music not found, warning messages all over, etc.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One solution would be to leave the &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; iTunes computer running and share the library. Then I can connect to that share in the living room. But when I do this, I have 3 computers eating electricity, and the added trouble of not being able to put files on my mp3 player from the living room machine. And there I am, thinking that my music was mine. Apperently not, iTunes decides to &amp;quot;protect&amp;quot; the music from being listened to by it's rightful owner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every now and again, I turn to Google to see if anybody has found a cure for this problem. But all Google comes up with, is more people having the same problem, hopelessly crude and complex rsync procedures, or way inferior music player alternatives. Today, I stubled upon &lt;a href="http://www.songbirdnest.com/home">Songbird&lt;/a>, a multi platform music player looking like iTunes. I haven't tried it out yet (I'm not that bold), it's version 0.2, and according to the makers merely a preview of what's to come. So not something I'll be managing my music library with for some time, but I'll be watching that space, because it sure looks like these guys pay attention to what they're doing!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm hoping to see a way to access my music from more than 1 computer in the near future, be it iTunes or SongBird. And I think many more people are hoping this to!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Want Security?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/07/05/want-security/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jul 2006 15:31:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/07/05/want-security/</guid><description>
&lt;p>According to Sophos security, the whole world should &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/5150508.stm">switch to macs to get rid of the security problems&lt;/a>. This would be great for business! Currently I do not order with companies who put up Word or Excel formatted price lists, simply because I can't (and to some extent refuse) open them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the long run however, this would shift the security problem to the Mac side of the world. Why do Microsoft machines get attacked so often? Simple: because their user base is large, which means there are more Microsoft (black hat) hackers out there. Additionally, the targeted audience is large in numbers. When the whole world uses Macs, the black hat hackers will turn to OSX as target.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But then again, the security model of OSX is (luckaly) a lot better than that of a Windows machine so the damage done largely depends on how the system is secured by the user. At least on a Mac you have the means of securing stuff properly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MP3 Gain for OSX</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/06/21/mp3-gain-for-osx/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jun 2006 15:44:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/06/21/mp3-gain-for-osx/</guid><description>
&lt;p>So here I am using iTunes on my Apple. So far so good. The downside is that I have an iBead as an mp3 player, so there are a few problems with that. First of all, iTunes only plays nice with the iPods (and a few other oddballs ;-). For me to put mp3's on my iBead, I can drag them over from iTunes onto the USB drive, but when things' don't fit, it just doesn't copy at all. Also, automatic random playlists aren't that automatic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, I can live with all these little problems. I can create a playlist limited to a particular size, empty my iBead and drag the mp3's over. But when I play them on my iBead, the volume levels are far apart. In the old days I used mp3Gain on my PC to level out all volumes, which worked great. But iTunes has it's own take on that: It stores a relative volume in the file, and iPods know how to handle this properly, adjusting the volume. My iBead however, doesn't.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tonight I went out to look for a tool which could adjust the volumes of my mp3's on my Mac mini. And guess what? I found it! &lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/beryrinaldo/AudioTron/MacMP3Gain/">MacMP3Gain&lt;/a> does it all, and it is currently processing my complete library, adjusting all volumes. It has a &amp;quot;nice&amp;quot; option so it won't hog all processing power. I think it will be finished somewhere tommorow afternoon. It claims to be lossless, so I guess I can run it on my complete library every once in a while without having to worry about which files are new or not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Finding double entries in iTunes</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/23/finding-double-entries-in-itunes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 May 2006 16:03:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/23/finding-double-entries-in-itunes/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The Mac has been on for the past few days, even with the Maxtor FAT32 250GB drive connected, without problems. I hope it doesn't break down again, because I'd have to bring it to a different Mac store and explain the whole thing again... Anyway, I was playing with iTunes and found a simple trick to find double entries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Open a Terminal, go to the root of your iTunes music collection folder and type
find . -name &amp;quot;*1.mp3&amp;quot; -type f&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This will give you a list of all tracks ending with &amp;quot;1.mp3&amp;quot;, which is how iTunes renames double-entries. Do not look at the filenames, but rather select the artist in iTunes with the double tracks, and use the &amp;quot;show double entries&amp;quot; in iTunes to do the rest.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It isn't much, but it saves you the trouble of finding double tracks in your 8 zillion tracks ;-) .
Have fun!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mac Drama Day</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/20/mac-drama-day/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2006 16:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/20/mac-drama-day/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="t_img_6298.jpg" alt="Mac Support guy on the job in Uitgeest">
So, finally the first post on my blog since 2 weeks of Mac absence. I really got annoyed by the repair guys at Mac support the past few days. I started calling them daily, and discovered if you don't, your repair just simply will sit there on a shelf. For some strange reason, they ordered a superdrive for my Mini, the guy on the phone promised me he would install it on friday as soon as he got it. So I called in friday afternoon to see how things are going, and guess what? The drive was in, but not in my Mac! They promised me they would install it and call back. You guessed it: they didn't.This mornig I decided to drive over there, because they essentially promised it would be ready yesterday. Although nobody called me, apperantly the repair was done, and I could take it home. On the receipt it said &amp;quot;superdrive and memory swapped, hardware test, everything ok&amp;quot;. So I took it home, connected it and booted it in single-user mode. Since my trust in these guys had dropped to an all-time low, I decided to run at least 3 full memtests. At the very first run, it failed, with the &lt;strong>exact same error as two weeks ago&lt;/strong>. I was furious! Not only did they take 2 weeks to swap out a non-faulty superdrive, they didn't swap the memory, although they lied on the receipt about having done so!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I put it back in the box, to spend another half hour driving to Uitgeest. I demanded that the mini was repaired while I was waiting. Suddenly, there were tech-guys available, although they claim to do no repairs on saturday. Wierd. I spent an hour waiting, and a young kid comes to ask me for my &lt;strong>password&lt;/strong>, can you beleive that? You can't do that! Besides, they just spent 2 weeks repairing it without ever needing my password, and now they do? I explained to him that he didn't need my password to run memtest, and that I wasn't planning on giving it to him. Back to the repair desk he went.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind me in line there was a lady who wanted to pick up her &amp;quot;repaired&amp;quot; ipod (they don't repair those, they just keep yours in for 2 weeks and then give you a new one). The tech guy said that nobody called her, and she replied (insulted) that she did speak to one of the guys and he was very clear on the phone about the ipod being ready to be picked up. After 20 minutes of walking around and talking to eachother the techguys &amp;quot;suddenly&amp;quot; found the ipod, and gave it to her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my waiting I constantly noticed how other people were also treated like I had been treated: Polite, but slow, and constanly making excuses about the slow cash register, the stupid network, how a collegue forgot to to this-and-that in the system, etc. etc. But it &lt;em>always&lt;/em> resulted in a long wait for the customer. It is clear to me that the macsupport store has to do something about both their technical and people skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally my Mac arrived, and the guy said he swapped the memory modules. I said that those were allready swapped. He denied, and I showed him the receipt. He mumbled something about a faulty batch of memory modules, and shoved the box in my direction, making it clear that he did not know what to do with that information. I asked if I could test the Mac, because I didn't feel like going home only to discover the problem was still not solved. He said he couldn't do that. I asked him to run memtest for me. He said he wasn't allowed to run non-apple approved software. He refused to get his boss when I asked him to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I walked to reception, and asked for the manager. The manager had left, but I talked to his backup about this problem. She also couldn't do much, as there was a music event going on in the store, and it was crowded. I explained to her that if I got home to find out the Mac was still defective, I would call the show owner on monday. She politely answered my questions, wrote down my name and off I went again.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At home, I booted the mac in single user mode (again) and ran memtest (again). While it ran, I noticed that the last receipt I just got, describing the memory module swap, looked funny. I had been given more expensive memory modules... huh? And on the first repair note, there was only a typed remark &amp;quot;swapped memory&amp;quot;. Strange. Memtest completed 3 runs without errors, as expected. It is now 17:08, and I have been driving back and forth between my home and the shop, and waiting at the shop since 10:15 this morning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My conclusion is that they started the HW test, and it crashed while doing the superdrive diagnostics. The crash was not actually caused by the superdrive, but by the software hitting the memory softspot. They swapped out the superdrive and wrote a silly comment about the memory to keep me happy, while actually never touching those modules. That's why I got the exact same error this morning. When they actually did swap the memory modules this afternoon (like I asked them to do 2 weeks ago) the problem was gone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I bought a Mac because I was tired of my PC crashing, but the pas two weeks I have experienced something worse: repair people who are polite but slow, refuse to listen, understand and do what you ask them to, don't return your calls, and give you your hardware back -- unrepaired.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope I don't have to bring in more Apple stuff for repairs anytime soon...&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mac Support... is... slooowww</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/16/mac-support-is-slooowww/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 May 2006 15:59:02 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/16/mac-support-is-slooowww/</guid><description>
&lt;p>As you've probably read, my brand new Mac Mini has a memory problem. I have brought it in for repair, but I am &amp;quot;slightly irritated&amp;quot; by the speed at which the guys from the &lt;a href="http://www.macsupport.nl/home.php">www.macsupport.nl&lt;/a> stores pick things up.&lt;/p>
&lt;table >
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Friday, May 6th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >I've found out that the mini has a consistent, reproducable memory problem. I suspect a technician could even tell which of the two memory modules it is judging from the faulty address (faulty single bit even, for the technical readers amongst us). It's late in the evening so I have to wait for the next day to call. I printed out a screenshot of the memory error and location, and put that in the box with the mini, to make sure they have a clear problem description.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Saturday, May 7th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Started calling the shop. They state that the tech support guys are not in on saturday. Strange, since they installed the memory modules on a saturday when I bought the thing. Can't the same guy swap out both modules so I have my machine back? Finding out which module is faulty can be done in the shop without me waiting. No apperantly not. I tried to call 3 of their shops, of which Amsterdam didn't even return my call even though I asked the operator to tell them to call me back.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Sunday, May 8th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Although the shop in Amsterdam claims to be open, they are to busy to pick up the phone.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Monday, May 9th:
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >I tried to call the new shop in Haarlem, but I get a "Sorry all lines are busy" message all day. At the end of the day I decide to drive to the shop. The shop is open, but they have network and phone problems (thanks to KPN, they claim). Because it is a new shop eveybody is uncertain as to what to do, and it takes me 45 minutes (!) to get the Mac mini to be taken in for repairs, even though I was helped the moment I entered the shop. They warn me that the repair is going to take a week (!).
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr >
&lt;td valign="top" >Tuesday, May 16th
&lt;/td>
&lt;td >Still no call from the shop in Haarlem. When I try to call, I notice they still have the same phone line problems. So, I drive to the shop again to find out how the repairs are going. They in form me that my Mac is "scheduled for repair on the 19th"!. So it has been sitting there for almost 2 WEEKS! And then they haven't even begun to look at the problem. They expect it to be repaired and ready to be picked up at Monday, May 22nd at the earliest.
&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/table>
As you can read, this is not a happy start of my 1600+ euro Apple adventure. I really hope they can get their logistics and repair process in shape. I really like the Mac mini, but I sure don't like the way Mac support takes their time to switch to memory modules and run a diagnostics tool.</description></item><item><title>Mac Mini Crash: Maxtor not the problem</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/06/mac-mini-crash-maxtor-not-the-problem/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 May 2006 15:56:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/06/mac-mini-crash-maxtor-not-the-problem/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="r_img_4139-cutout.jpg" alt="Memtest">
In my &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2006/05/04/mac-mini-crash-cause-located/">last post&lt;/a>, the Maxtor OneTouch drive was the prime suspect of the spontanious crashing of the Mac. Tonight the Mac mini crashed again, but this time without the Maxtor connected to it. So I set out to do a thourough memory test in single user mode, running &lt;a href="http://www.memtestosx.org/">memtest&lt;/a>. And after a few iterations it was there: The dreaded memory failure. I guess I have to bring my mini back to the store to get replacement memory.Intermitting problems like this are terrible. They are hard to find, and you loose all trust in your computer, saving every 3 seconds, hoping you don't loose anything. If the external drive was really to blame, I would seriously have doubted the implementation of the USB drivers, because the system crashes without warning, without logging or anything. A memory failure was actually the more plausible casue all the time, since the kernel just stops because the processor(s) reach a part of the memory where there was supposed to be code, but has become garbage. To be able to log, the processor has to execute code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mac Mini Crash: cause located</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/04/mac-mini-crash-cause-located/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2006 15:54:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/04/mac-mini-crash-cause-located/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_maxtorfs.gif" alt="Windows screenshot showing Maxtor drive stats">
Today I spent some more time using Google to find information on why my Mac suddenly crashed. I am now 99% that the cause of this all is my &lt;a href="http://www.nextag.com/Maxtor-ONE-TOUCH-II--zz68645598zB2z2--COMPARE-PRICES-html">Maxtor OneTouch 250GB&lt;/a> drive, which was formatted as one big Fat32 partition (screenshot). Although I connected it to a friend's iMac for a short period without problems, and it has worked on my Mac mini for a while, I keep finding discussions about people with &lt;a href="http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/readflat.asp?forum=1017&amp;amp;message=16514032&amp;amp;changemode=1">crashed Macs&lt;/a>. I have not installed the Maxtor software, so that's &lt;a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tiger10.html">not the problem&lt;/a>.I have disconnected the Maxtor drive last Saturday, and my Mac has been up and running ever since, without problems. I can almost rule out memory related issues, because when I startup Eclipse while running &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/imovie/">iMovie&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/idvd/">iDVD&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/thunderbird/">Thunderbird&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/download/">iTunes&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="http://blogger.xs4all.nl/rrolfje/archive/2006/04/23/88885.aspx">Clutter&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler&lt;/a> (yes all at the same time), the system keeps on running. In fact, it is still responding to user input as if I had only one of those programs running. Only very minimal swapping with 2GB memory, and when swapping, OS X is very efficient about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, my plans are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Only connect the maxtor to a PC while it is still Fat32.
2. Share the drive on the PC, and try to empty it as much as possible (move data to Mac and the fileserver)
3. Run [Rember](http://www.kelleycomputing.net:16080/rember/) in single user mode for a few iterations this weekend to rule out memory problems.
4. Decide on a filesystem to use on the Maxtor, and reformat it.
5. Re-connect the Maxtor OneTouch to the Mac and see if the gremlin is killed.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It is very likely that the drive is going to be formatted with the &lt;a href="http://www.whoi.edu/CIS/services/desktop/macintosh/about/extended_format.html">&amp;quot;Mac Os Extended&amp;quot; filesystem&lt;/a>, but I'm not sure about &lt;a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107249">journalling&lt;/a> yet. The disadvantage of all this is that the drive can not be used to transfer files between a PC and a Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still it feels funny. Some people actually can create 100GB+ Fat32 partitions they can use on their Macs. I can read and write to the drive too, but at some point my Mac decides it has been enough and kills itself (probably after finding the windows crud ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sorry for the linking-frenzy, I had a lot of links I wanted to share with you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eclipse on Intel Macs</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/03/eclipse-on-intel-macs/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 May 2006 15:47:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/05/03/eclipse-on-intel-macs/</guid><description>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse&lt;/a> looks really nice on OS X. I can tell, I have it running on my mac Mini duo core. If you have problems getting it to start, and the logfile complains about linker errors, chances are you have the PPC version of the eclipse app file. To check this, Ctrl-click on the eclipse.app file. If it doesn't say &amp;quot;(Universal)&amp;quot; somewhere next to &amp;quot;Type:&amp;quot;, then you need to download a newer version. Get the &lt;a href="http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops/S-3.2RC2-200604281315/index.php">Eclipse 3.2 RC2&lt;/a> or higher, and make sure you download the &amp;quot;Mac OSX (Mac/Carbon)&amp;quot; version.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->I have milestone 5 running here, because I didn't pay attention when downloading. I will upgrade to RC2 tommorow I guess...
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> I was worried about not being able to develop older java versions. Particularly installing an older version of Java on my Mac worried me. But Eclipse gave me a nice surprise: OS X has all Java versions installed by default (1.3 up to 1.5), and eclipse auto-detects them! Brilliant! Next up: Installing Maven.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Just now, I had a terrible experience with my new Mac Mini. It crashed on me, two times in a row. It did this while importing a movie from a Sony Handycam with iMovie. During the import, suddenly the screen goes blank, and the machine does a &amp;quot;hard boot&amp;quot;. I restarted iMovie, dragged the imported files from the trashcan and continued as normal. But now I've noticed that my Spotlight is no longer returning search results. Looking for &amp;quot;Terminal&amp;quot; resulted in amsolutely no results at all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I checked the /var/log/system.log for errors, but I can only find the things logged during boot. I expected to find some kind of error just prior to the unscheduled boot, but there is none. The problem is so &amp;quot;hard&amp;quot; that the system doesn't even get (or takes) the time to write information about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tried to repair the Spotlight database with the &lt;a href="http://www.macintouch.com/tigerreview/spotlight.html">tips found here&lt;/a>, and found the solution. Open the Terminal (from Application/utilities) and do the following (requires root password, be carefull!):&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>rolf:/var/log rolf$ sudo mdutil -E /
Password:
/:
Volume index removed. Index will be rebuilt automatically.
rolf:/var/log rolf$ sudo mdutil -i off /Volumes/MAXTOR\ FS/
/Volumes/MAXTOR FS/:
Indexing disabled for volume.
rolf:/var/log rolf$ sudo mdutil -E /Volumes/MAXTOR\ FS/
/Volumes/MAXTOR FS/:
Volume index removed.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Yes, you noticed correctly, I turned off indexing on my Maxtor 250 USB disk and cleaned it's database as well. Spotlight indexes USB disks, and I thought it best to focus on indexing the system disk first.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After doing this I waited for Spotlight to finish indexing. You can tell when it's finished by clicking on the magnifying glas. It takes about 2-3 minutes to finish on my machine. After it finished I still had no results. To give the system a chance to clean up and restart I shut it down, and powered it back up. Problem solved! Spotlight works fine again (phew).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and another tip: don't minimize iMovie when importing a movie from your camera, it will stop importing, but leaves the tape running, letting you think it is still working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It seems that although OS X is more stable than Windows, and can cope better with unexpected reboots (never lost a file during this whole adventure), it is not entirely bullet proof. If I find a way to avoid reboots in iMovie I'll let you know. Smaller projects and more saving is the way to go for now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting with different users to 1 server (2)</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/28/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Apr 2006 16:07:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/28/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server-2/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This is a simple followup after my last post. Pim did also &lt;a href="http://zwet.com/2006/04/27/mounting-shares-with-applescript/">look into this&lt;/a>, and made a script which doesn't pop up finders by simply calling &amp;quot;mount&amp;quot;. There is only one minor glitch: the script pops up an error when the mount already exists. With my brilliant programming expertise, I quickly solved that:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>try
mount volume &amp;quot;cifs://KAGE/iTunes&amp;quot; as user name &amp;quot;iTunes&amp;quot;
with password &amp;quot;yourpasswordhere&amp;quot;
mount volume &amp;quot;cifs://KAGE/incomming&amp;quot; as user name &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot;
mount volume &amp;quot;cifs://KAGE/foto&amp;quot; as user name &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot;
on error errText number errNum
(* Not the nice way, simply ignore errors. If the mount did
not work, the user needs to see what is going on. How?
Use Finder to mount, and it will give you the error *)
end try
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This script will try to mount the drives, ignoring errors. Replace the servernames, usernames and passwords with your own. What you can do is run the script at logon, or every minute in a cron job. I checked /var/log/system.log, but the script does not generate errors there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the rate we're going, maybe we'll even solve the &amp;quot;re-mount drives on return from sleep&amp;quot; problem. Let's see if we can find a wakeup event on which we can run the script.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Connecting with different users to 1 server</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/27/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Apr 2006 16:08:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/27/connecting-with-different-users-to-1-server/</guid><description>
&lt;p>With my Mac mini in a Windows LAN, I have the following problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. I can add my (cifs windows) network shares to my login script (Preferences -&amp;gt; Accounts -&amp;gt; Login), but when the mac wakes up from sleep, they are gone.
2. When I want to connect to 2 shares on the same server, but one with a different account than the other, it doesn't work. On login, the system chooses one of the accounts and uses it to connect to both network shares.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I think both problems are terrible, and particularly the way you connect to a network share in Finder using a password is confusing to say the least. Searching the web reveals hundreds of posts of people having the same problems. One wonders why apple didn't solve this already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a simple workaround for this problem by copy/pasting some script from several websites into the script editor (sorry guys, I'm lazy). I then saved it both as application and as source. I use the script to mount the drives at logon, and re-mount them when the Mac wakes from sleep mode. Until I come up with a better idea, or somebody can point to a nicer &amp;quot;Apple way&amp;quot; solution, or Apple fixes this dreadful problem in OS X, here is my script:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>tell application &amp;quot;Finder&amp;quot;
open location &amp;quot;cifs://WORKGROUP;iTunes@KAGE/iTunes&amp;quot;
open location &amp;quot;cifs://WORKGROUP;Guest@KAGE/incomming&amp;quot;
end tell
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>When running a script like this for the first time, the system asks you the passwords. Type them in and save them in your keyring. The next time they won't be asked, and you have no readable passwords in your script. Nice. The downside of this script is that it opens a ton of finder windows. I have nosed around in Automator but can not find a way to close them automatically. I also tried to record a script, but that gave me an even more &amp;quot;unusable&amp;quot; script.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope this helps you too. If you think this can be done in a nicer way (without too much scripting) please let me know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update:&lt;/strong> Seems I was to quick about the keyring app. I did need to add passwords to the script (add &amp;quot;:password&amp;quot; after the userid without the quotes). Stupid machine does not understand what I want.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Flip4Mac 2.0.2 does not install on Intel Macs</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/24/flip4mac-202-does-not-install-on-intel-macs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Apr 2006 16:09:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/24/flip4mac-202-does-not-install-on-intel-macs/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Bummer, I was hoping to be able to open those wmv files I get mailed in the Quicktime window. Although OS X claims to be supporting Flip4Mac since 10.4.5 (I have 10.4.6), the &lt;a href="http://www.flip4mac.com/wmv_download.htm">Flip4Mac installer&lt;/a> exits with a message about not being able to install on Intel based hardware.I guess I'll have to live with -gasp- &lt;a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/windowsmediaplayerformacosx.html">Windows Media Player 9 for OS X&lt;/a> for now. I tried to install it, but it requires mee to enable the Microsoft Office testdrive kit, which I am definetely NOT planning on doing, wmv files are not worth those troubles. I am hoping on a universal binary Flip4Mac soon...&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Funny thing is, that the Windows Media player for OS X is actually only 7 MB in size. I seem to recall that Media Player 10 for Windows XP took quote some time downloading, and ate nearly all of the free space on my harddisk, which I was really pissed about. But then again, since they require me to enable the Microsoft Office testdrive, they have probably allready sneaked part of the player into the OS X distribution, the bastards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Comment from Antonio on how to solve this: &lt;em>You can get Flip4Mac to work through Rosetta, but Telestream is a couple weeks away from releasing a public Universal beta version. Check this blog for some details and other info bits: &lt;a href="http://flip4mac.blogspot.com/">http://flip4mac.blogspot.com/&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My response: _Great, just used the tip on blogspot, and it worked! I can now view wmv files nicely. Thanks for the tip! _&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting iChat to work with Googletalk</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/23/getting-ichat-to-work-with-googletalk/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2006 16:12:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/23/getting-ichat-to-work-with-googletalk/</guid><description>
&lt;p>This is probably the 1001st post about this subject, but I can't help thinking that some people actually give up on this. It is a simple protocol, simple program and should be simple to get working. I spent a few hours (!) before I finaly found the solution. I searched the internet but this answer never seems to be given on forums. I'll try to be complete, so here it goes:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Configure iChat as &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/support/talk/bin/answer.py?answer=24076">described by Google&lt;/a>. If you still can not connect, there is a good chance you have started the firewall on your mac, and it is blocking iChat. Open the system preferences, and in the &amp;quot;Internet and network&amp;quot; section select &amp;quot;Share&amp;quot;. You will notice a firewall tab in the middle. Select it, and make sure there is a thickmark next to &amp;quot;iChat Bonjour&amp;quot;, like in this screenshot:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="o_firewall-ichat.gif" alt="iChat settings">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Sorry for the Dutch layout, I'm sure you'll find it with this pointer.)
This action solved my iChat connection problem. I also installed &lt;a href="http://www.adiumx.com/">Adium&lt;/a>, which also had connection problems. The firewall setting solved the Adium problems aswell.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I'm not sure which chat client to choose. iChat is more integrated into OSX, and imported my google contacts without a problem. Adium did not import any contacts. I'm sticking to iChat for now, hoping that the integration with the rest of the system will give me some pleasant surprises.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh and yes, you've noticed correctly, I've bought a Mac. The desktop PC at home crashed one time too many.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Want those CD boxes back?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/23/want-those-cd-boxes-back/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2006 16:11:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2006/04/23/want-those-cd-boxes-back/</guid><description>
&lt;p>When I used iTunes on XP, I was jealous of the terrific plugins for iTunes running on OS X. Now that I have a Mac Mini, I was looking for a plugin to update the album art automatically. &lt;a href="http://www.zwet.com/">Pim&lt;/a> showed me an even better alternative: &lt;a href="http://www.sprote.com/clutter/">Clutter&lt;/a>! Not only can it search and update album art automatically for you, it also gives you the option to put your albums on your desktop. This is the best virtual alternative to having CD's lying on your desk. A must have for iTunes users I think. Very nice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sidebar: My file server still runs Windows, and it has been working flawlessly for the past 5 years, being constantly &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; and storing family pictures and music. My laptop is an XP machine and works quite nicely too. So maybe it's because I don't need to, but for now I don't want to &lt;a href="http://zwet.com/2006/04/20/apple-switch-complete-but-the-demon-is-still-here/">install XP on my Mac&lt;/a>. It feels like a step back, it adds a sour taste to your strawberry icecream :-). XP is nice, but not as a desktop. Too much bloatware.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
