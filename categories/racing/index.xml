&lt;/a>After just missing the title last year, it looked like you were going to just miss it this year, too. The race in Brazil was very thrilling to watch, and in the last few corners of the very last lap were very exiting to watch, especially just getting Glock in the last corner. Nice race, good show. Find somebody to sell the movierights to ;-) . I'm looking forward to seeing you race again next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cheers,
Rolf&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sell Car, Buy Helicopter</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/11/sell-car-buy-helicopter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2008 18:37:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/11/sell-car-buy-helicopter/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I really like my racing car, but it takes up so much time to get everything right and be competative, that I've decided to sell it. The plan is to use the money to buy a Helicopter. Yes that's right. An airborne lownmawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->In the past, I have had much fun getting the [HPI Proceed](http://www.hpiracing.com/kits/proceed/proc-m.htm) 1:8 scale IC car to Europe, [driving](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/reports/20020808/index.html) it, [promoting](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/) it, and [talking about it](http://www.rc-racing.com/cgi-bin/backtalk/pistachio/confhome?conf=hpi) online. A few years ago I had to stop my hobby because it took too much time, and I didn't want to half-ass it. Because I had so much fun with it, and spent so much time with it, I couldn't really get myself into selling it. But now, I'm ready. [I'm selling the car.](http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/3102253)
&lt;p>I think it's a nice time to switch hobbies, and go airborne. I have had lots of fun with my amazing Silverlit helicopter, and about a week ago one of my friends bought a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYELAHulc8">Walkera 60B Electric helicopter&lt;/a>. It look's like fun, so I'm getting one as soon as I've raised enough funds. Selling the car will definetely help :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good teaser huh, you didn't think I had a full-scale racing car and was getting a full-scale helicopter, now did you? :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Drachten open for Dragracing in 2008!</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/03/11/drachten-open-for-dragracing-in-2008/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2008 21:15:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/03/11/drachten-open-for-dragracing-in-2008/</guid><description>

&lt;p>The organization of the Dakar rally has cancelled the rally because some idiots are planning terrorist attacks. Instead of doing a partial rally, or a couple of stages around Lissabon, the complete rally is cancelled. I really think this is unacceptable for all riders, sponsors and TV stations depending on this rally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All the time and money people have put into making it to Dakar is wasted. Next year it will be harder to get sponsors for the rally, because the sponsors will not risk investing large amounts of money in a rally which &amp;quot;may or may not&amp;quot; start. All those private riders which loaned money from the bank will have a hard time returning next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Although not nearly as bad as for the competitors, this means a lousy start of 2008 for me and a lot of Dakar fans eagerly waiting the start of the rally, which was scheduled tommorow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dakar 2008, 4 days to go.</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/01/01/dakar-2008-4-days-to-go/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2008 01:50:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/01/01/dakar-2008-4-days-to-go/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Only 4 days until the biggest and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakar_Rally">toughest rally in the world&lt;/a> starts in Lisboa. After 2 weeks, on the 20th of Januari, the bikes will finish their trip in Dakar (oh yes, and there will be some cars too, and some uninteresting truckers). The number to keep an eye on (again) this year is bike 041. It's &lt;a href="http://www.dakarsport.com/index.php?quicklink=teams&amp;amp;teamID=11">Miriam Pol&lt;/a>, who is planning on finishing high in the bikes classification.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->[![Dakar 2008 Schedule, thanks to DakarSport.com](route2008schema.thumbnail.jpg)
&lt;p>](route2008schema.jpg)People who think that trucks are the best, you probably want to stop reading here. Still reading? I will explain why I think bikes are the absolute real rally competitors (yes, your opinion may differ. Start your own blog. Bye).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Trucks&lt;/strong> are the fastest brute-force machines on the track, and the drivers will push other competitors aside. Inside the trucks, 5 people are &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/714390/mister-dakar.html">smoking cigarettes&lt;/a> and sipping coffee while bumping cars off the road at 200km/h on a small sandy road. They arrive at the stops first, have a beer and a good night's sleep, and leave the next morning to shove some more dust in the eyes of other competitors. When interviewed,these &amp;quot;men&amp;quot; will complain about branches, sand, other competirors, the food, the tires, and their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_underwear">longjohns&lt;/a> being too tight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cars&lt;/strong>, the largest group of competitors, are second-fastest on the track, and often have nice fights for position. There are always &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/579212/masuoka-san-ii.html">2 people in a car&lt;/a>, one navigator and one driver. They work together when digging out their car out of the sand dunes, and solve technical problems. High speeds and great driving skills make cars nice to look at for about 5 minutes, I really enjoyed &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/642034/robby-gordon---dakar-2007.html">Robbie Gordon&lt;/a>'s &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/642035/html/">Hummer&lt;/a> last year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="afbeelding-3.png">&lt;img src="afbeelding-3.thumbnail.png" alt="Mirjam Pol During Shamrock Rally 2007, Marokko">
&lt;/a>&lt;strong>Bikes&lt;/strong> are probably the smallest group of competitors. These are in my eyes the only real competitors. They ride their bikes 800km a day through the &lt;a href="dsc_1649.jpg">desert&lt;/a>, 15 hours straight at a time. All roadbook preperations, &lt;a href="http://gallery.zoom.nl/image/667416/html/">riding&lt;/a>, navigating and repairs during the tests are done by themselves. When they arrive late at night, they have to prepare the roadbook for the next day, and catch a few hours of sleep. The next morning, they are the earliest starters, returning to the desert with nothing more than their bikes, water, and candybars to eat. During the day, the bikes are passed by cars, and dumbass maniac truckdrivers often making the bikes tip over and leaving them in a ditch besides the road (if not worse).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bike on the right is this year's outfit of Mirjam. Purple bike, and the ever Orange Helmet. Go Mirjam!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Houd Drachten open voor Dragracen</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/06/04/houd-drachten-open-voor-dragracen/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jun 2007 20:21:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/06/04/houd-drachten-open-voor-dragracen/</guid><description>

&lt;p>In het laatste verslag van de Dakar rally op RTL7 was in de uitslag van de motoren &lt;a href="http://www.mirjamgoesdakar.nl/">Miriam Pol (warning audio ahead)&lt;/a> van de lijst gevallen. Er werd ook geen woord aan gewijd in het verslag. Voor de mensen die bang zijn dat ze uit de race is: Nee dat is ze niet, &lt;a href="http://www.dakar.com/2007/DAK/RIDERS/us/equipage/93.html">Miriam staat 97e op dit moment&lt;/a> en heeft zo te zien ook een sponsor gevonden in &lt;a href="http://www.jbtrading.nl/">JB Trading&lt;/a> als ik de laatste beelden van haar shirt en de banners op de site mag geloven. Geen vraagtekens meer op de motor (en bankrekening).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Een ander intressant team om te volgen is Tim Coronel en vriendin Gaby Uljee. De ultieme relatietest, je vriendin kaart laten lezen in een woestijn, tijdens een race naar Dakar.

&lt;p>The big car manufacturers could have done &lt;a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/02/17/eveningnews/main1329941.shtml">this&lt;/a>, but they didn't, because they are sponsored by the big oil companies. And your local governement is swimming in taxmoney that's added to your oil price. And no, they don't want to get rid of the cars, despite of what they say. The nicest thing for governements would be the complete population sitting in single-seated, gas guzzling cars in a traffic jam accross the country!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that a few school kids have proven that you don't need oil to race, and several American race series run on methanol (no that's not an oil product), can we please stop making cars that run on gasoline? And by the way, also stop pumping money into the super-dangerous liquid nitrogen cars? All that is purely to keep the oil companies in the same place: monopoly. Do you really think they do it for the environment? What if I told you that your current petrol car can run on bio-degradable methanol, with almost no changes? If you have a very modern car, the fuel system will even auto-adapt! But noooo, they won't tell you that, because the oil companies and governements want to keep the monopoly intact!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Not that you can really do anything about it though. Except maybe not buying liquid-nitrogen or hybrid cars. There are better technical alternatives, although not on the market yet. Boycot the &amp;quot;environmentally friendly&amp;quot; car, force them into making a &lt;em>real&lt;/em> environmentally friendly car.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yes, I'm driving a diesel, and a motorbike. And no, I'm not worried about oil-shortage. It's all bullshit from the oil companies, who could have come up with alternatives a long while ago, but chose not to. If there really was an oil shortage, we all would have been driving on methanol for quite some time now. And co2 emmisions would have been reduced to absolutely 0.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Where's North again?</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2005/10/03/wheres-north-again/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2005 12:57:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2005/10/03/wheres-north-again/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Lately, I've been collecting race circuit locations using &lt;a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth&lt;/a>. It's really nice to see the sometimes very detailed satelite images of race circuits. You can actually see the seperate kerbstone blocks of silverstone, and see how many cars there were parked at the time the picture was taken. You should try it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What really started to catch my interest is the fact that the maps of circuits as they are used in logo's or (worse) &amp;quot;how to get there&amp;quot;-maps are almost never of the &amp;quot;north pointing up&amp;quot; type. An example:
The circuit &amp;quot;Road America&amp;quot;, which is located a few miles north-east of Atlanta, Georgia, has a &lt;a href="http://www.roadatlanta.com/trackmap.lasso">web-site&lt;/a> which shows you a detailed map of the circuit, as well as pointers to the nearest highways. I have grabbed an image (because they only have these stupid noise making flash movie thingied nobody is interersted in after the second visit). It looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_road-atlanta.gif">&lt;img src="o_road-atlanta.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, in my quest to find this circuit using Google Earth, I found the circuit to be along the 53, halfway from the I85 to the I985, just like the directions stated. But, the circuit seemed to be &amp;quot;turned around:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_road-atlanta-google.gif">&lt;img src="o_road-atlanta-google.gif" alt="">
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have noticed this with a lot of ciruits. I understand the need of turning and simplifying the circuit to make a nice logo, but when the circuit is depicted next to driving directions, I would make the map &amp;quot;north side up&amp;quot; so nobody gets confused. In the first image, the I85 apears to be west of the circuit, while it is actually east of the circuit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google Earth location of Road America (so you can check for yourselves):&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="o_img_2708.jpg">&lt;img src="o_img_2708.jpg?w=128" alt="">
&lt;/a> Today I found the first good use for the milling machine. I had this cast aluminum housing for an electronics project, with ridges on the inside. I made a hole for a connector in it, but I never got the nut on the inside flat to the surface because of the ridges on the inside of the housing. I decided to use the mill to flatten the surface on the inside of the housing. The housing did not fit in the clamp, so I had to find a way to get it attached to the bed of the mill in a different way. I took a piece of wood, drilled two holes in it and bolted that to the bed of the mill. Then, I used long plywood screws and another piece of wood to hold the housing. In the picture on the right you can see this construction. I used a test indicator to align the house to the X-axis of the bed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>Since I only needed a plane large enough to place a ring and nut on, I roughly adjusted the 6mm mill to just not touch the bottom of the housing. I milled down to the point where the ridges were not visible. The image on the left is the result of the work. The mill is a very nice tool to adjust ready-made electronics housing to your likings.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
