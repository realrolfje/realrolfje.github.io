&lt;p>Normally I try to steer clear of any politics, beliefs, or war on this blog, but I could not resist to link to this &lt;a href="http://video.google.nl/videoplay?docid=1296126090432829344">google video&lt;/a> I found, where Arab-American psychologist Wafa Sultan has some strong words to say to (extremist) Muslims on Al-Jazeera. Although broadcast in February 2006, I just noticed it, and I think she has some good points.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Personaly I don't believe you should interfere with people's lives if they're more than 10km away from your home (and they shouldn't interfere with yours). Say hello to your neighbour and ask how his/her day went. You'll notice that you can often help or solve your neighbours problems easily. Stop worrying about those people 10.000km away. If their neighbours follow your example, soon the world will be an even better place!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
