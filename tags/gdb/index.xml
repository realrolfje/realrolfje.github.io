&lt;/a>On Mac OSX, when installing Garmin BaseCamp 4.1.2 from the Appstore, there is a chance that importing downloaded routes in gdb or gpx files from your local machine will not work. The error you'll get is &amp;quot;[filename].gdb not found&amp;quot;, in a popup much like the one shown here. If you open the console app, you'll see the following error in the logfile:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>sandboxd[28092]: ([27931]) Garmin BaseCamp(27931) deny file-read-data /Users/rolf/Desktop
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This means that the OSX Sandbox mechanism does not allow Garmin BaseCamp to read files in that folder. I have briefly searched documentation on how to grant BaseCamp the rights to read files there, but I couldn't find anything that would work. I did find a way to work around this problem though: Garmin BaseCamp does have rights to read your Garmin device. So here we go:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> 1. Temporarily copy the files you want to import in Garmin BaseCamp onto your device (or in my case: the extra SD card in the device).
2. Start Garmin BaseCamp, and select &amp;quot;File&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Import…&amp;quot;.
3. Browse to the Garmin SD card and select the gdb file to import. Voila. That will get it into BaseCamp.
4. Delete the gdb file from the Garmin. We don't need it anymore, the Garmin was just a place where BaseCamp could read the file.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>From here on, everything should work as normal. This is just a workaround. If anybody finds out how to really fix this problem let me know.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
