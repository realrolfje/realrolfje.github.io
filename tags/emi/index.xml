&lt;p>In a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/02/06/steve-jobs-gets-it/">previous post&lt;/a> I told you that Steve Jobs wants to provide DRM-free music through iTunes, but was held back by music companies. Steve must have had a few long and hard talks, because now EMI and Apple are teaming up to provide high quality &lt;a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/04/02/drm.free.music.on.itunes/">DRM-free tracks through the iTunes music store&lt;/a>, priced at $1.30. The same track, in a lower sound quality, with DRM costs $0.99. For &lt;a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/04/02/what-those-thirty-cents-buy-you/">30 cents&lt;/a>, you get a track you can actually use, with a higher bitrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time this could be a trick by Apple to get around the legal issues currently being discussed about iTunes music not being available to other players than the iPod. Smart eh?&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
