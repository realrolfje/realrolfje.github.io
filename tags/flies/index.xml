&lt;/a> Lorenzo had a great idea. In stead if being one of those &amp;quot;having fun at the bar&amp;quot; ideas that never actually see the light of day, Lorenzo followed through. Did you ever have that urge to just take a gun and shoot that fly that is constantly buzzing around your head or food? Well now you can. Check out his invention at &lt;a href="http://www.bugasalt.com">www.bugasalt.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seeing his gun, I remembered making pea-shooters at high school from a roll of tape and a party balloon. I adjusted the idea for flies (smaller nozzle), and it works beautifully. It only holds one shot, and it looks not nearly as cool as the shotgun idea of Lorenzo, but if you can't wait to start shooting those flies, here's how to make your own low-budget, one-shot salt shooter. Enjoy!&lt;/p>
