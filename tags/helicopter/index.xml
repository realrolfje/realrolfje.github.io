&lt;/a>This weekend was a lot of fun. Saturday night I got to fly Leo's Walkera 60B electric helicopter. That's one piece of impressive (and scary) machinery. Although it feels easier to fly than my 4#3B, I still &amp;quot;managed&amp;quot; to crash it. Luckaly the blades can be easily replaced, and after tightening a bunch of screws and replacing a pin in the main gear, it was good to fly again. We flew 3 times, and had to repair the helicopter after each flight :-) I hope I can treat you with good shots of the Walkera 60B next time, there are not many high-quality images of it online.&lt;/p>

&lt;/a>After getting the hang of the big 60B, I got home and did some flying with my little &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2008/08/10/new-helicopter-to-master/">Walkera 4#3B&lt;/a>. I can now seem to hover it slightly longer than last week, but I still &amp;quot;landed&amp;quot; the thing in the strangest places. Normally there's not much damage, but this time I broke the tail rotor axle. In the pictures, you can also see the crack in the canopy which I simply repaired with a piece of tape. After I repaired the tailrotor, I crashed it again, this time breaking the rear tail altogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The third crash this weekend was not mine, but &lt;a href="http://paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules/ew_filemanager/08content/motogp/ducati/gb/motogp-fri-stoner-quickest-641.jpg">Kacey Stoner&lt;/a>'s. In the MotoGP race at Misano, Rossi almost high-sided in the first lap, and that little mistake made the gap with Stoner about 3 seconds. As Rossi was trying to gain, Stoner went down in the hairpin in the 8th lap. I sure would have liked to see Rossi and Stoner battle for the win. All in all &lt;a href="http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2008/Rossi+takes+home+victory+and+75+point+advantage+at+Misano">it was a nice race&lt;/a>, won by Valentino Rossi.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Helicopter to Master</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/08/10/new-helicopter-to-master/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2008 20:41:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/08/10/new-helicopter-to-master/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>A friend of mine and me ordered 2 Walkera 4#3B electric model helicopters 3 weeks ago. Last frinday, they finally arrived, and this weekend we had some good fun flying them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think flying a &lt;a href="http://rolfje.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/helicopter-fun/">PicooZ&lt;/a> is hard, don't even start thinking about one of these. It looks easier on the &lt;a href="http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=VbvD4OYOqt8">youtube video's&lt;/a> than it seems. I have some experience with RC models (mainly cars and boats), but flying this helicopter is really hard. I can not get it to hover steadily, I need some serious practice to tame this baby. :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I just took my camera out to shoot make some action shots of the heli's in the air, when one of them crashed so hard that the tail boom broke. We ordered some spare parts for both 'copters, they'll arrive somewhere next week. In the meantime you can check out some of the &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/3362467">photographs I made&lt;/a> of my Walkera on my desk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sell Car, Buy Helicopter</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/11/sell-car-buy-helicopter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 May 2008 18:37:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2008/05/11/sell-car-buy-helicopter/</guid><description>
&lt;p>I really like my racing car, but it takes up so much time to get everything right and be competative, that I've decided to sell it. The plan is to use the money to buy a Helicopter. Yes that's right. An airborne lownmawer.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->In the past, I have had much fun getting the [HPI Proceed](http://www.hpiracing.com/kits/proceed/proc-m.htm) 1:8 scale IC car to Europe, [driving](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/reports/20020808/index.html) it, [promoting](http://www.xs4all.nl/~rrolfje/) it, and [talking about it](http://www.rc-racing.com/cgi-bin/backtalk/pistachio/confhome?conf=hpi) online. A few years ago I had to stop my hobby because it took too much time, and I didn't want to half-ass it. Because I had so much fun with it, and spent so much time with it, I couldn't really get myself into selling it. But now, I'm ready. [I'm selling the car.](http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/3102253)
&lt;p>I think it's a nice time to switch hobbies, and go airborne. I have had lots of fun with my amazing Silverlit helicopter, and about a week ago one of my friends bought a &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PYELAHulc8">Walkera 60B Electric helicopter&lt;/a>. It look's like fun, so I'm getting one as soon as I've raised enough funds. Selling the car will definetely help :-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good teaser huh, you didn't think I had a full-scale racing car and was getting a full-scale helicopter, now did you? :-)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Helicopter fun</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/06/helicopter-fun/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Dec 2007 22:08:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2007/12/06/helicopter-fun/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>A couple of friends of mine bought me a great toy for my birthday: my very own personal Helicopter! It is an amazing piece of engineering, weighing only a couple of grams, and having a very simple remote with the usual &amp;quot;left/right/forward/reverse&amp;quot; type of remote.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->After a bit of practice, it is actually pretty easy to fly. Once you get it to stop wiggling in the air (patience!), it will start flying forward at a slow pace, at which point you can steer it left or right. While turning, it will loose or pick up speed depending if you make a left or right turn. The least bit of draft in the house will "feel" like a storm, so keep the windos closed.
&lt;p>See &lt;a href="http://www.23hq.com/rolfje/album/2712717">my photo's&lt;/a> of it taking off from my coffee table and flying into the kitchen. I only made still photo's, but if you want live video, you can find other people's PicooZ helicopter videos at &lt;a href="http://nl.youtube.com/watch?v=w12m1yprBwY">YouTube&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
