&lt;p>Today Steve Job's yacht was launched from a dock a few miles from my house. I went there with some friends and we shot some awesome footage of this incredible ship. Through the glass, we could see the 7 iMacs which are used to control the ship. There are also large doors on the side and the back, I suspect these will be used to launch boats or jetskis into a nice warm Mediterranean water.&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- more -->We were able to catch a glimpse of it's name on the stern: "Venus". Too bad Steve didn't get to enjoy this. I hope is family and friends have a great time aboard this ship.

&lt;/a>Dear Apple,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am truly sorry for the huge loss and wish every Apple employee, family, and friends of Steve strength in these tough times. Through Apple, Steve improved the lives of many people in the world, including mine. By hiring great people and (re)building the Apple brand, he will continue to do so even long after his death. Steve lives on in all of us.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Joining our virtual group hug,
Rolf&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Letter to Tim Cook</title><link>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2011/09/20/open-letter-to-tim-cook/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2011 20:04:12 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realrolfje.github.io/rolfje.com/2011/09/20/open-letter-to-tim-cook/</guid><description>

&lt;/a>Dear Tim,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am certainly not the first, nor the last to congratulate you with your new position at Apple. I'm sure there will be many great things to come for Apple and it's customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Apple has become the doctor that doesn't fix the pain, but cures the illness and improves our daily digital lives. Please make sure Apple keeps it's focus, perseverance and good taste in the endless search for true quality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tell Steve and Jony I said hi, and keep up the good work. If there's anything I can help you with, you know how to reach me ;-)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cheers,
Rolf&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
