&lt;p>My wife has this great Macbook Pro 15&amp;quot;, and I &amp;quot;don't mind&amp;quot; using it every now and then. I noticed that when running on batteries, screen updates are a bit strange:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> * When scrolling down a webpage, the page get garbled. Scrolling the garbled piece out of the window and in again sometimes fixes it.
* When resizing a Finder window, the icons in the window flicker a lot, you can see them being cleared and redrawn.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I noticed more people having these problems on several forums, and I also read that resetting the PRAM could fix it. Well, I just reset the PRAM and it seems to have fixed it, indeed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I used the method mentioned on &lt;a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1379">Apple's support page&lt;/a>, which tells you to shut the computer down, and boot it up holding the command, option, P and R keys. As soon as you see it shutting down after you've started it up, release the keys.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is all I did, and it seems to have fixed it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
